description: Synchronize all memory bank files with current session context
argument-hint: "[--full] [--quick]"
allowed-tools: Read(*), Edit(*), Bash(date:*, echo:*)
---

# Memory Sync ‚Äî Universal Context Synchronization

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: YOU MUST complete ALL steps below IN EXACT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP any step. ONLY use Read, Edit, and Bash tools as specified.

Synchronizes all `.claude/memory/` files with current session state, ensuring perfect context preservation across sessions.

## Usage

```bash
# Full synchronization (recommended after significant work)
/memory-sync --full

# Quick sync (active context only)
/memory-sync --quick

# Default: Smart sync based on session activity
/memory-sync
```

---

## EXECUTION STEPS - MANDATORY

## STEP 1: Parse Arguments - MANDATORY

**ACTION**: Detect sync mode

**DETECT** (YOU MUST check for these EXACT strings):
- IF message contains `--full` ‚Üí Set MODE="full" (sync all memory files)
- IF message contains `--quick` ‚Üí Set MODE="quick" (activeContext only)
- IF neither ‚Üí Set MODE="smart" (analyze session, decide what to sync)

**OUTPUT**: Tell user which mode activated:
- "Full synchronization mode (--full)"
- "Quick sync mode (--quick)"
- "Smart sync mode (analyzing session activity)"

---

## STEP 2: Record Sync Timestamp - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST USE Bash TOOL FIRST** before any other step

**EXACT COMMAND** (run this immediately):
```bash
date +%s > .claude/tmp/last-memory-sync
```

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL**:
- Intelligent status notification system reads this file
- Footer shows "Last sync: Xm ago" based on this timestamp
- MUST update BEFORE syncing files (not after)

**VALIDATION**:
- ‚úÖ Ran `date +%s > .claude/tmp/last-memory-sync` command
- ‚úÖ Command executed successfully
- ‚úÖ Did this BEFORE reading/editing any memory files

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip this step
- ‚ùå DO NOT do this AFTER syncing (must be BEFORE)
- ‚ùå DO NOT use different timestamp format

---

## STEP 3: Analyze Session Activity - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ANALYZE**:
1. **Operations Count**: Count Read, Edit, Write, Bash operations THIS session
2. **Files Modified**: Which files were changed (check conversation history)
3. **Technical Decisions**: Were architecture/tech choices made?
4. **Progress Changes**: Were tasks completed or started?
5. **New Blockers**: Were blockers discovered?
6. **Pattern Changes**: Were new patterns adopted?

**OUTPUT** (show user the analysis):
```
üìä Session Analysis:
   - Operations: [count] (Read: X, Edit: Y, Bash: Z)
   - Files modified: [count] files
   - Technical decisions: [Y/N]
   - Tasks completed: [count]
   - New blockers: [count]
   - New patterns: [Y/N]

Sync mode: [full/quick/smart]
Will update: [list of files to sync]
```

**DETERMINE WHAT TO SYNC**:
- **IF MODE="quick"** ‚Üí ONLY activeContext.md
- **IF MODE="full"** ‚Üí ALL applicable memory files
- **IF MODE="smart"** ‚Üí Decide based on session activity:
  - IF 50+ operations OR technical decisions ‚Üí sync like --full
  - IF 10-49 operations ‚Üí sync activeContext + progress
  - IF <10 operations ‚Üí sync activeContext only

   - Session updates recorded: [N]
   - Total operations: [count]

üéØ Next session will load with complete context awareness!
```

---

## CRITICAL VALIDATIONS - MANDATORY

**BEFORE CLAIMING SUCCESS**, verify:
- ‚úÖ Completed STEP 2 (timestamp) BEFORE all other steps
- ‚úÖ Used Edit tool for ALL modifications (NEVER Write)
- ‚úÖ All timestamps in correct format (UTC)
- ‚úÖ Preserved all existing content (append-only)
- ‚úÖ Updated ONLY files with actual changes
- ‚úÖ Session summary appended to activeContext.md

**IF ANY VALIDATION FAILS** ‚Üí Report: "‚ùå Failed at STEP [X]: [reason]"

---

## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN

- ‚ùå DO NOT use Write tool (will erase history - use Edit)
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip STEP 2 (timestamp must be set FIRST)
- ‚ùå DO NOT remove old content from memory files
- ‚ùå DO NOT invent fake progress or decisions
- ‚ùå DO NOT update productContext unless scope truly changed
- ‚ùå DO NOT claim success if validations fail

---

## Purpose

The `/memory-sync` command provides intelligent synchronization of your memory bank:
- Updates `activeContext.md` with current focus and progress
- Appends session summary to `progress.md`
- Records technical decisions in `decisionLog.md`
- Refreshes `productContext.md` if project scope changed
- Updates `systemPatterns.md` if new patterns emerged

## Examples

### After Feature Completion
```bash
/memory-sync --full
# Updates: activeContext, progress (marks feature complete), decisionLog (records decisions)
```

### After Bug Fix Session
```bash
/memory-sync
# Updates: activeContext with fix summary, maintains continuity
```

### Quick Context Update
```bash
/memory-sync --quick
# Updates: activeContext only, fastest sync
```

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Perfect Continuity**: Next session starts with complete context
- ‚úÖ **Historical Record**: Every session preserved with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Decision Tracking**: Technical decisions never lost
- ‚úÖ **Progress Visibility**: Always know what's completed and what's next
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Recognition**: Coding standards emerge and are recorded

## Automatic vs Manual Sync

### Automatic Sync (via hooks)
- **Session End**: Basic activeContext update via stop hook
- **Low Impact**: Minimal context updates only

### Manual Sync (this command)
- **Full Control**: Decide what to sync and when
- **Rich Context**: Detailed analysis and updates
- **After Significant Work**: When automatic sync isn't enough

## Best Practices

1. **Run after completing significant work**
   - Feature completion
   - Major refactoring
   - Technical decision made
   - Architecture change

2. **Use --full for milestone sessions**
   - End of day
   - End of sprint
   - After major achievement

3. **Use --quick for frequent updates**
   - Every few hours
   - After small tasks
   - Quick context preservation

4. **Trust automatic sync for minor work**
   - Small bug fixes
   - Documentation updates
   - Minor tweaks

## Integration with Other Commands

- **After `/map-codebase`**: Sync to record codebase mapping completion
- **After `/umb`**: `/memory-sync` is more comprehensive, `/umb` is faster
- **Before session end**: Ensure context is preserved before closing

## Output

```
üîÑ Memory Sync Started...

‚úÖ Analyzed session activity: 47 operations
‚úÖ Updated activeContext.md (Current focus + session summary)
‚úÖ Updated progress.md (2 tasks completed, 1 in progress)
‚úÖ Updated decisionLog.md (1 technical decision recorded)

üéØ Memory Bank synchronized successfully!
üìÅ Context preserved in .claude/memory/

Next session will load with complete context awareness.
```

## Technical Notes

- Appends with UTC timestamps (never overwrites history)
- Preserves markdown formatting
- Validates files before writing
- Creates backups for safety
- Works offline (no external dependencies)

**Related Commands**: `/umb`, `/context-update`
**Frequency**: Run after significant work sessions
**Impact**: High - ensures perfect context continuity
