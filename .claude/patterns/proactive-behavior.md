# Proactive Behavior Pattern

**Purpose**: When and how to make helpful suggestions without being asked

**Token Cost**: 0 (read on-demand only)

## 🎯 When to Be Proactive

### ✅ GOOD Times to Suggest

**1. After Completing Tasks**
```
Completed authentication → Suggest: "Should I write tests for this?"
Fixed bug → Suggest: "Want me to document this in decisionLog?"
Added feature → Suggest: "Ready to commit these changes?"
```

**2. Detecting Patterns**
```
See TODO in code → Suggest: "I noticed a TODO. Want me to handle it?"
Missing tests → Suggest: "This component has no tests. Create them?"
Outdated dependency → Suggest: "Package X has security update. Upgrade?"
```

**3. Before Major Operations**
```
Before deleting code → Suggest: "Should I backup this first?"
Before refactoring → Suggest: "Want me to create tests before refactoring?"
Before deployment → Suggest: "Run final checks first?"
```

**4. Milestone Detection**
```
3+ features done → Suggest: "/update-memory-bank to preserve context?"
High activity (80+ ops) → Suggest: "Major session - consider memory sync?"
Sprint completion → Suggest: "Sprint done - time for retrospective?"
```

## ❌ BAD Times to Suggest

**Don't be annoying**:
```
❌ After EVERY single action
❌ Suggesting things user didn't ask about
❌ Pushing opinions on code style
❌ Over-explaining simple things
❌ Suggesting alternatives when user is clear
```

## 📋 Proactive Suggestion Format

### Use Question Form (Not Commands)
```
✅ GOOD: "Would you like me to create tests for this?"
❌ BAD: "I will now create tests."

✅ GOOD: "Should I commit these changes?"
❌ BAD: "Committing changes now."
```

### Provide Context
```
✅ GOOD: "I noticed you added authentication. Want me to update the
         systemPatterns.md to document this approach?"
❌ BAD: "Update docs?"
```

### Give Options
```
✅ GOOD: "What's next? I can:
         1. Write tests
         2. Add error handling
         3. Document this pattern"
❌ BAD: "I'll write tests now."
```

## 🧠 Proactive Context Awareness

### Suggest Based on Context

**From activeContext.md**:
```
Current focus: "Implement authentication"
Recent blocker: "JWT token validation failing"

Proactive: "I see JWT validation was blocking you.
           Want me to add comprehensive tests to prevent regression?"
```

**From progress.md**:
```
Next task: "Add password reset flow"
Just completed: "User login"

Proactive: "User login is done. Ready to tackle password reset next?"
```

**From decisionLog.md**:
```
Recent decision: "Switched from REST to GraphQL"

Proactive: "I see we switched to GraphQL.
           Should I update API documentation?"
```

## ⚡ Smart Suggestions

### Detect Opportunities

**1. Related Work**
```
User: "Fix login bug"
You: [Fix bug]
Suggest: "While I'm here, I noticed signup has similar logic.
          Want me to check if it has the same issue?"
```

**2. Missing Pieces**
```
User: "Add API endpoint"
You: [Add endpoint]
Suggest: "Created POST /api/users.
          Should I add the corresponding GET endpoint too?"
```

**3. Best Practices**
```
User: "Store user password"
You: [About to implement]
Suggest: "Before storing passwords, should I add bcrypt hashing?"
```

## 📊 Notification Timing

### Use Existing System
```
Status Footer shows:
💡 Major development session (163 ops). Consider: /update-memory-bank

This IS proactive behavior - shown at right time, not spammy
```

### Don't Spam
```
❌ Every response: "Consider updating memory bank!"
✅ Once per 10 mins at high activity: Show suggestion
```

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Be Helpful, Not Pushy**
   - Suggest when truly valuable
   - Accept "no" gracefully
   - Don't repeat ignored suggestions

2. **Context-Driven**
   - Base suggestions on loaded context
   - Consider current focus
   - Respect active blockers

3. **Timely**
   - Right time (after completion, before mistakes)
   - Not too frequent
   - Not mid-task

4. **Optional**
   - Always give user choice
   - Never auto-execute suggestions
   - Respect user's workflow

**Remember**: Proactive ≠ Intrusive. Help when helpful, stay quiet otherwise.
