## 💬 First Comment Template

**Post this IMMEDIATELY after launching**:

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Your Name], creator of Mini-CoderBrain.

**The Problem I Solved**:
If you use AI coding assistants like Claude Code, you've experienced this:
• Every new session: "What framework are you using?"
• 5-10 minutes wasted re-explaining your project
• Lost context between sessions
• Hitting "Prompt too long" errors

I lost 30+ hours last month to this. So I built Mini-CoderBrain.

**What It Does**:
✅ Gives Claude persistent memory across all sessions
✅ 4 customizable AI behavior modes (default/focus/research/implementation)
✅ Privacy-first metrics (100% local, nothing sent anywhere)
✅ 79.9% token reduction for longer conversations
✅ 85% test coverage - production ready

**How It Works**:
1. Install in 30 seconds (drop .claude/ folder in your project)
2. Run /init-memory-bank (one-time setup)
3. Claude learns your project and remembers forever

**Why Open Source**:
Built this to solve my own problem. Keeping it free forever because this pain point is too fundamental to put behind a paywall.

**Tech Stack**:
• Pure Bash (POSIX compliant)
• Zero dependencies
• Works with any language/framework
• Linux + macOS compatible

**Looking Forward**:
Would love your feedback! Especially interested in:
• What AI tools you currently use
• Your biggest frustration with AI context loss
• Features you'd want in v2.2

## 🎯 Response Templates

### When Asked "How is this different from [competitor]?"
```
Great question! Key differences:

Mini-CoderBrain:
✅ Hook-based integration (seamless)
✅ 4 AI behavior modes
✅ Zero dependencies (pure Bash)
✅ 100% local (privacy-first)
✅ 85% test coverage
✅ Free & open source

[Competitor]:
[Honest comparison based on features]

Different approach, different benefits. We prioritize simplicity, privacy, and open source values.
```

### When Asked "What's the catch?"
```
No catch! Genuinely free and open source (MIT license).

Why free?
• Built it for myself first (already has value)
• Community contributions make it better
• Privacy claims need to be auditable (open source)
• Developer tools should be accessible

No hidden costs, no data collection, no bait-and-switch later. Just a tool I use daily and want to share.
```

### When Asked "Does this work with [other AI tool]?"
```
Currently Claude Code specific, but architecture is extensible.

The hook system is Claude Code-native, but the memory bank concept (context files, behavioral patterns) could work with other tools.

If there's demand for [other AI tool] support, I'm open to PRs or collaboration! The pattern library (4,700 lines) could benefit any AI assistant.
```

### When Someone Reports a Bug
```
Thanks for the report! 🙏

Can you share:
1. OS (Linux/macOS/Windows WSL)?
2. Claude Code version?
3. Error message or behavior?

I'll investigate and fix ASAP. You can also:
• Open a GitHub issue: [link]
• Check existing issues: [link]

Really appreciate you testing this!
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Engagement Hacks
1. **Upvote 5 other products** before launching (karma++)
2. **Comment on other launches** during your day (visibility++)
3. **Tag people** who might find it useful (relevant, not spam)
4. **Share milestones** (50 upvotes, 100 upvotes) on Twitter
5. **Post updates** in first comment (edited throughout day)

### Timing Tricks
- **Submit 11:30 PM PST** (be ready at midnight)
- **Avoid weekends** (low traffic)
- **Avoid holidays** (low engagement)
- **Check PH calendar** (avoid major launches same day)

### Content Optimization
- **Tagline test**: Show 5 people, can they explain in 10 seconds?
- **Video test**: Watch with sound OFF - still clear?
- **Screenshot test**: Readable on mobile?
- **Description test**: Compelling in first 80 chars?
