## Template 1: Launch Post (r/ClaudeAI)

**Title**: "I built Mini-CoderBrain to give Claude perfect memory across all coding sessions"

**Body**:
```markdown
Hey r/ClaudeAI! 👋

I built **Mini-CoderBrain** to solve a problem I had: Claude forgetting everything about my project every time I start a new session.

**The Problem**:
- Explaining your project structure to Claude every session
- Claude asking "what framework are you using?" for the 10th time
- Losing context between sessions
- Hitting "Prompt too long" errors when trying to provide context

**The Solution**:
Mini-CoderBrain gives Claude perfect memory by maintaining a lightweight context system that:
- Remembers your project across all sessions (tech stack, patterns, recent work)
- Reduces context tokens by 79.9% (longer conversations, no bloat)
- 4 customizable AI behavior modes (default/focus/research/implementation)
- Privacy-first metrics tracking (all local, nothing sent anywhere)
- Works with ANY programming language or framework

**Key Features**:
✅ Universal - works with any project type
✅ 30 seconds to install
✅ Zero dependencies
✅ 85% test coverage
✅ Comprehensive test suite (12 suites, 70+ tests)
✅ Open source & free forever

**Example**:
Session 1: "Add authentication" → Claude asks for tech stack, patterns, etc.
Session 2 (with Mini-CoderBrain): "Add password reset" → Claude remembers everything, just does it

Would love feedback from the community! What features would you find most useful?

## Template 2: Feature Focus (r/opensource)

**Title**: "Open source project: Mini-CoderBrain - AI context awareness system with 4,700 lines of behavioral patterns"

**Body**:
```markdown
Hey r/opensource! 👋

I just released **Mini-CoderBrain v2.1** - an open source AI context awareness system for Claude Code.

**What makes it interesting**:

1. **Behavioral Patterns Library** (4,700 lines)
   - Zero-token cost reference patterns
   - Teaches AI project-specific conventions
   - Read on-demand, not injected into every prompt

2. **Customizable AI Modes**
   - Default: Balanced behavior
   - Focus: Deep work, minimal interruptions
   - Research: Exploratory, asks questions
   - Implementation: Fast execution, follows patterns

3. **Smart Metrics System**
   - Privacy-first (100% local)
   - Track tool usage, session duration, productivity
   - `/metrics` command for insights

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - 12 test suites, 70+ individual tests
   - 85% pass rate, 100% critical features verified
   - Tested on itself (dogfooding)

**Tech Stack**:
- Pure Bash (POSIX compliant)
- No external dependencies
- Works on Linux + macOS
- Integrates with Claude Code via hooks

**Looking for**:
- Contributors (especially for cross-platform testing)
- Feedback on architecture
- Ideas for v2.2 features

## Template 3: Problem-Solution (r/programming)

**Title**: "Stop explaining your codebase to AI every session: A context awareness solution"

**Body**:
```markdown
**The Problem We All Face**:

Using AI coding assistants is great, until you realize they forget everything every session:

```
Session 1:
You: "Add authentication"
AI: "What framework are you using?"
You: *explains entire tech stack*

Session 2:
You: "Add password reset"
AI: "What framework are you using?"
You: *facepalm*
```

**The Root Cause**:
AI tools have no persistent memory. They don't remember:
- Your project structure
- Your coding conventions
- What you did last session
- Technical decisions you made

**One Solution: Mini-CoderBrain**

I built this open source system that gives Claude Code persistent memory:

**How it works**:
1. Auto-detects project structure and tech stack
2. Maintains lightweight context files (productContext, systemPatterns, activeContext)
3. Loads context once per session (79.9% token reduction)
4. Remembers across sessions

**Real Example**:

*Before*:
- 5 minutes explaining project every session
- Repeating tech stack, patterns, conventions
- Losing context between sessions

*After*:
- Claude remembers everything
- Zero explanation needed
- Instant productivity

**Features**:
- Universal (any language/framework)
- 4 AI behavior modes
- Privacy-first metrics
- Comprehensive testing

**GitHub**: https://github.com/kunwar-shah/mini-coder-brain

**Tech Details**:
- Pure Bash (POSIX compliant)
- Hook-based integration
- 85% test coverage
- 2,900 lines of test code

Curious what other approaches people have tried for this problem?

## Template 4: Technical Deep Dive (r/devtools)

**Title**: "Built a hook-based AI context system that reduces prompt tokens by 79.9%"

**Body**:
```markdown
**Project**: Mini-CoderBrain - Context awareness for Claude Code

**Problem**: AI coding assistants lose context between sessions, causing:
- Repeated explanations of project structure
- "Prompt too long" errors from context duplication
- Lost productivity from context rebuilding

**Solution Architecture**:

1. **Hook-Based Integration**
   - `session-start.sh`: Load context once
   - `user-prompt-submit.sh`: Inject micro-context (< 200 chars)
   - `stop.sh`: Auto-save session updates
   - `pre-compact.sh`: Memory cleanup before context limit

2. **Context Structure**:
   - `productContext.md`: Static project overview
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Coding conventions
   - `activeContext.md`: Current focus, recent work
   - `progress.md`: Sprint tracking
   - `decisionLog.md`: Technical decisions (ADRs)

3. **Token Optimization**:
   - Load-once principle (context in conversation history)
   - Micro-context injection (< 1000 chars)
   - Smart cleanup (archive old session updates)
   - Result: 79.9% token reduction

4. **Behavioral Patterns Library**:
   - 4,700 lines of reference patterns
   - Zero token cost (read on-demand)
   - Pre-response protocol (5-step checklist)
   - Anti-patterns documentation

**Performance**:
- Session start: < 1 second
- Memory sync: < 2 seconds
- Codebase mapping: < 30 seconds (one-time)
- 25% longer conversations before hitting limit

**Testing**:
- 12 test suites
- 70+ individual tests
- 85% pass rate
- Dogfooding (tested on itself)

**Tech Stack**:
- Pure Bash (POSIX compliant)
- No dependencies
- 18 hook files (100% POSIX compliant)
- Cross-platform (Linux + macOS)

**GitHub**: https://github.com/kunwar-shah/mini-coder-brain

Open to technical questions and architecture discussions! 🔧

## Template 5: Show HN Style (r/programming)

**Title**: "Show Reddit: Mini-CoderBrain – Give Claude Code perfect memory"

**Body**:
```markdown
Hi everyone,

I built Mini-CoderBrain to solve my own frustration with AI coding assistants forgetting everything between sessions.

**What it does**: Gives Claude Code persistent memory so it remembers your project, conventions, and recent work across all sessions.

**Why I built it**: I was tired of explaining my tech stack, project structure, and coding patterns every single session. It was wasting 5-10 minutes at the start of every coding session.

**How it works**:
- Maintains lightweight context files in `.claude/memory/`
- Auto-loads context once per session
- Tracks recent work, decisions, and progress
- 4 customizable AI behavior modes

**Key innovation**: Load-once context loading reduces prompt tokens by 79.9%, allowing 25% longer conversations before hitting limits.

**Status**:
- v2.1 just released
- 85% test coverage
- Tested on Linux (macOS compatible)
- Production ready

**Links**:
- GitHub: https://github.com/kunwar-shah/mini-coder-brain
- Docs: https://kunwar-shah.github.io/mini-coder-brain/

**Looking for**: Feedback, contributors, and users to test in real projects.

Happy to answer questions! 🧠

## Template 6: Community Engagement (r/ClaudeAI)

**Title**: "What features would you want in a Claude Code context awareness system?"

**Body**:
```markdown
Hey r/ClaudeAI! 👋

I've been working on **Mini-CoderBrain** (open source context awareness for Claude Code) and I'm planning v2.2 features.

**Current features (v2.1)**:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- 4 AI behavior modes (default/focus/research/implementation)
- Smart metrics tracking
- 79.9% token reduction
- Privacy-first (all local)

**Ideas for v2.2**:
1. Multi-project support (switch between projects)
2. Team collaboration (shared context)
3. Context templates for common frameworks
4. AI-powered context cleanup
5. Integration with other AI tools

**Questions for the community**:
- What frustrates you most about Claude Code's context handling?
- What features would make your workflow better?
- Would you use shared context for team projects?
- Any other pain points I should address?

I'm building this in the open and want to make sure it solves real problems for real developers.
