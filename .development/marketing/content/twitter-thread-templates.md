## Template 1: Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**:
```
Stop wasting time explaining your project to Claude every session 🧠

I built Mini-CoderBrain to give Claude perfect memory across all coding sessions.

Thread 🧵 on how it works + why it saves 10 min every session ⬇️

#ClaudeAI #DevTools
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**:
```
The Problem:

Session 1:
"Add auth"
"What framework?"
*explains everything*

Session 2:
"Add password reset"
"What framework?"
*same questions again*

This was killing my productivity 😤
```

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**:
```
The Solution: Mini-CoderBrain

✅ Remembers your project forever
✅ Auto-loads context once per session
✅ 79.9% token reduction (longer conversations)
✅ Zero setup hassle (30 seconds to install)
✅ Works with ANY project type

No more context loss 🚀
```

**Tweet 4 (Key Features)**:
```
Key Features:

🎭 4 AI Behavior Modes
   • Default (balanced)
   • Focus (deep work)
   • Research (exploratory)
   • Implementation (fast execution)

📊 Privacy-first metrics (100% local)
🔧 Universal (any language/framework)
🧪 85% test coverage
```

**Tweet 5 (How It Works)**:
```
How it works:

1. Install in 30 seconds
2. Run /init-memory-bank
3. Claude learns your project
4. Start coding

Context persists across ALL sessions.

Claude remembers:
✅ Tech stack
✅ Coding patterns
✅ Recent work
✅ Technical decisions
```

**Tweet 6 (Results)**:
```
Results:

Before:
⏱️ 5-10 min explaining project
🔄 Repeating same info every session
💬 Hitting "Prompt too long" errors

After:
⚡ Zero explanation needed
🧠 Claude remembers everything
💰 25% longer conversations

Time saved: ~10 min/session
```

**Tweet 7 (Demo)**:
```
See it in action 🎥

[Attach demo GIF showing:
1. Session start with context loaded
2. Making a request without explaining project
3. Claude responding with full context awareness]

No context questions. Just instant productivity.

## Template 2: Feature Spotlight Thread

**Tweet 1**:
```
Mini-CoderBrain's Behavior Profiles are 🔥

4 AI modes that change how Claude thinks:

🎯 Default - Balanced
🔍 Focus - Deep work
🔬 Research - Exploratory
⚡ Implementation - Fast execution

Thread on how each mode changes your workflow ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2**:
```
🎯 Default Mode

Best for: Normal development work

Behavior:
• Asks clarifying questions when needed
• Suggests improvements
• Proactive but not pushy
• Balanced explanations

Example: Building a feature step-by-step with helpful suggestions along the way
```

**Tweet 3**:
```
🔍 Focus Mode

Best for: Deep work sessions, complex features

Behavior:
• Minimal interruptions
• No suggestions unless critical
• Executes requests directly
• Batches questions for end of task

Example: 2-hour deep coding session without constant "should I also add X?" questions
```

**Tweet 4**:
```
🔬 Research Mode

Best for: Exploring new codebases, learning patterns

Behavior:
• Asks exploratory questions
• Explains "why" not just "what"
• Suggests alternatives
• Educational responses

Example: Understanding how a legacy codebase handles authentication
```

**Tweet 5**:
```
⚡ Implementation Mode

Best for: Executing predefined plans, bulk changes

Behavior:
• No questions (uses context)
• Fast execution
• Follows established patterns
• Minimal explanations

Example: Refactoring 20 files to new pattern - just do it, no talking
```

**Tweet 6**:
```
Switch modes anytime:

```
/context-update profile focus
/context-update profile research
/context-update profile implementation
/context-update profile default
```

Context persists. Behavior changes instantly.

It's like having 4 different AI pair programmers 🤯
```

**Tweet 7**:
```
The game-changer:

Each mode reads the SAME context but behaves differently.

Same project knowledge.
Different interaction style.

Match the AI to your current task, not the other way around.

## Template 3: Problem-Solution Thread

**Tweet 1**:
```
AI coding assistants have a fatal flaw:

They forget EVERYTHING between sessions 😤

Lost 30 hours last month re-explaining my projects.

Here's how I fixed it 🧵⬇️

#ClaudeAI #DevTools
```

**Tweet 2**:
```
The Forgetting Problem:

Every new session:
❌ "What database are you using?"
❌ "Where is the User model?"
❌ "What testing framework?"
❌ "What did we do last time?"

I knew the answer was in conversation history.

But AI tools don't persist it 😭
```

**Tweet 3**:
```
The Root Cause:

AI has context in ONE session.
Next session = blank slate.

It's like having a developer with amnesia.

Every morning: "Wait, what project is this?"

Productivity killer.
```

**Tweet 4**:
```
I tried everything:

1. Massive README (AI didn't read it consistently)
2. Copying context every session (hit token limits)
3. External tools (too complex, didn't integrate)

Nothing worked well.

So I built my own solution 🔧
```

**Tweet 5**:
```
Mini-CoderBrain:

Core idea: Lightweight memory bank files

`.claude/memory/`
├── productContext.md (project overview)
├── systemPatterns.md (conventions)
├── activeContext.md (recent work)
├── progress.md (sprint tracking)
└── decisionLog.md (technical decisions)
```

**Tweet 6**:
```
How it works:

Session 1: Load context once
Session 2+: Context already in history

Key insight: Once loaded, context persists naturally in conversation history.

No re-injection needed.
No token duplication.
Perfect continuity.

79.9% token reduction 📉
```

**Tweet 7**:
```
The Results:

Before:
⏱️ 10 min/session explaining project
😤 Repeating same info endlessly
💬 Hitting "Prompt too long" frequently

After:
⚡ Zero setup time
🧠 Claude remembers everything
💰 25% longer conversations

ROI: ~10 min saved per session
```

**Tweet 8**:
```

## Template 4: Tips & Tricks Thread

**Tweet 1**:
```
5 Mini-CoderBrain tips that 10x your productivity 🧠⚡

Most people don't know about these features.

Thread 🧵⬇️

#ClaudeAI #DevTools
```

**Tweet 2**:
```
Tip 1: Use /map-codebase for instant file access

Before:
Claude: "Where is the User model?"
You: "src/models/user.ts"

After /map-codebase:
Claude finds it instantly, no questions.

Run once, benefits forever 🗺️
```

**Tweet 3**:
```
Tip 2: Switch AI modes mid-session

Starting: Research mode (explore codebase)
Middle: Implementation mode (bulk changes)
End: Default mode (cleanup + docs)

Command: /context-update profile [mode]

Match AI to task, not task to AI 🎭
```

**Tweet 4**:
```
Tip 3: Use /memory-cleanup before big refactors

Clears old session data.
Reduces token usage by 60%.
Prevents "Prompt too long" errors.

Run it weekly or when prompted.

Everything archived, nothing lost 🧹
```

**Tweet 5**:
```
Tip 4: Check /metrics for productivity insights

See:
📊 Tools used most
⏱️ Session duration trends
🔧 Read vs Write vs Edit ratios
📈 Weekly activity patterns

100% local. Zero tracking.

Data-driven development 📈
```

**Tweet 6**:
```
Tip 5: Document decisions in real-time

After every major choice:

"Add this decision to decisionLog: Chose JWT over sessions because..."

Future you (and Claude) will thank present you.

No more "why did we do it this way?" 📝
```

**Tweet 7**:
```
Bonus: Combine all tips

Monday: /map-codebase
Daily: Switch profiles as needed
Weekly: /memory-cleanup
Monthly: Review /metrics

Result: Smooth, efficient, context-aware development 🚀
