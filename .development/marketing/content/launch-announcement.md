🧠 Introducing Mini-CoderBrain v2.1 – AI Context Awareness for Claude Code

Stop wasting time re-explaining your project to Claude every session.

**The Problem**:
AI coding assistants are powerful, but they forget everything between sessions. Every new coding session means:
• Re-explaining your tech stack
• Repeating coding conventions
• Losing context from previous work
• Wasting 5-10 minutes on setup

**The Solution**:
Mini-CoderBrain gives Claude Code persistent memory that works across all sessions.

**What's New in v2.1**:

🎭 **Behavior Profiles** (4 AI modes)
• Default: Balanced development
• Focus: Deep work, no interruptions
• Research: Exploratory, educational
• Implementation: Fast execution

📚 **Behavioral Patterns Library** (4,700 lines)
• Pre-response protocol (5-step checklist)
• Context utilization guidelines
• Proactive behavior rules
• Anti-patterns documentation
• Zero token cost (read on-demand)

📊 **Smart Metrics System**
• Privacy-first tracking (100% local)
• Tool usage breakdown
• Session duration tracking
• Weekly productivity reports

🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**
• 12 test suites, 70+ tests
• 85% individual test pass rate
• 100% critical features verified
• POSIX compliance (Linux + macOS)

**Key Features**:
✅ Universal - works with any project type
✅ Token efficient - 79.9% reduction, 25% longer conversations
✅ Privacy-first - all data stays local
✅ Production ready - 85% test coverage
✅ Zero dependencies - pure bash, POSIX compliant
✅ 30-second install - drop folder, run command

**How It Works**:
1. Install in 30 seconds (drop `.claude/` folder in project)
2. Run `/init-memory-bank` (one-time setup)
3. Claude learns your project structure and patterns
4. Context persists across all future sessions

**Results**:
• Time saved: ~10 minutes per session
• Token reduction: 79.9%
• Longer conversations: +25% before hitting limits
• Zero manual intervention after setup

**Open Source & Free Forever**:
MIT licensed, no tracking, no data collection, community-driven.

**Get Started**:
📦 GitHub: https://github.com/kunwar-shah/mini-coder-brain
📚 Docs: https://kunwar-shah.github.io/mini-coder-brain/
🚀 Release: https://github.com/kunwar-shah/mini-coder-brain/releases/tag/v2.1.0

Built this to solve my own frustration with AI context loss. Hope it helps you too! 🚀

# Mini-CoderBrain v2.1: Give Claude Code Perfect Memory

**Release Date**: [LAUNCH_DATE]
**Status**: Production Ready
**License**: MIT (Open Source)

## The Problem We're Solving

If you use AI coding assistants like Claude Code, you've experienced this frustration:

**Session 1**:
You: "Add authentication"
Claude: "What framework are you using?"
You: *explains tech stack, architecture, patterns*

**Session 2** (next day):
You: "Add password reset"
Claude: "What framework are you using?"
You: *facepalm*

AI tools are incredibly powerful for coding, but they have a critical flaw: **they forget everything between sessions**.

This causes:
• 5-10 minutes wasted re-explaining your project every session
• Inconsistent suggestions (AI doesn't remember past decisions)
• "Prompt too long" errors from trying to provide full context
• Lost productivity from context rebuilding

**The Cost**: For developers working 20+ sessions per month, that's **3-4 hours of pure productivity loss** monthly.

## The Solution: Mini-CoderBrain

Mini-CoderBrain is an open source context awareness system that gives Claude Code persistent memory across all sessions.

Think of it as giving Claude perfect memory about:
• Your project structure and tech stack
• Your coding conventions and patterns
• What you worked on recently
• Technical decisions you've made

### Architecture: Load-Once Principle

The key innovation is the **load-once architecture**:

**Traditional Approach** (Broken):
```
Turn 1: Load context (3000 lines)
Turn 2: Re-inject context (3000 lines) ← Duplication
Turn 3: Re-inject context (3000 lines) ← Waste
Turn 4: "Prompt too long" error ← Failure
```

**Mini-CoderBrain Approach**:
```
Turn 1: Load context once (3000 lines)
Turn 2+: Use conversation history (0 new lines)
Result: 79.9% token reduction
```

Once context enters conversation history, AI can reference it naturally without re-injection.

## What's New in v2.1

### 1. Behavior Profiles (4 AI Modes)

Customize how Claude interacts based on your current task:

**🎯 Default Mode** - Balanced development
• Asks clarifying questions when needed
• Suggests improvements proactively
• Balanced explanations

**🔍 Focus Mode** - Deep work sessions
• Minimal interruptions
• No suggestions unless critical
• Executes requests directly
• Perfect for 2-hour deep coding sessions

**🔬 Research Mode** - Exploratory work
• Asks exploratory questions
• Explains "why" not just "what"
• Suggests alternatives
• Great for understanding new codebases

**⚡ Implementation Mode** - Fast execution
• Zero questions (uses context)
• Follows established patterns
• Minimal explanations
• Ideal for bulk refactoring

Switch modes anytime with one command. Same context, different behavior.

### 2. Behavioral Patterns Library (4,700 lines)

Instead of injecting behavior rules into every prompt, we created reference patterns that AI reads on-demand:

• **Pre-Response Protocol**: 5-step checklist before every AI response
• **Context Utilization**: How to use memory bank files effectively
• **Proactive Behavior**: When and how to make suggestions
• **Anti-Patterns**: What NOT to do (banned behaviors)
• **Tool Selection**: Which tool to use for each task

**Result**: Zero token cost for behavioral training. Patterns are read only when needed.

### 3. Smart Metrics System

Privacy-first productivity tracking:

✅ **100% Local** - Nothing sent anywhere
✅ **Tool Usage** - Track Read, Write, Edit, Bash usage
✅ **Session Duration** - See how long you work
✅ **Weekly Reports** - `/metrics --weekly` for insights
✅ **Productivity Patterns** - Understand your workflow

Example metrics:
```
📊 Tool Usage (Last 7 Days):
   Read: 156 ops (42%)
   Edit: 89 ops (24%)
   Write: 67 ops (18%)
   Bash: 58 ops (16%)

⏱️  Session Duration: Avg 47 min
📅  Most Productive: Tuesday (38% of ops)
```

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

Production-ready with extensive testing:

• **12 Test Suites**: Commands, hooks, edge cases
• **70+ Individual Tests**: Comprehensive coverage
• **85% Pass Rate**: Critical features 100% verified
• **Dogfooding**: Tested on mini-coder-brain itself
• **POSIX Compliance**: Works on Linux + macOS
• **2,900 Lines of Test Code**: Robust infrastructure

## Technical Highlights

### Context Structure

Five memory bank files, each with specific purpose:

```
.claude/memory/
├── productContext.md      # Project overview (static)
├── systemPatterns.md      # Coding conventions (static)
├── activeContext.md       # Current focus (dynamic)
├── progress.md            # Sprint tracking (dynamic)
└── decisionLog.md         # Technical decisions (append-only)
```

### Hook-Based Integration

Seamless automation through Claude Code hooks:

• **session-start.sh**: Load context once at session start
• **user-prompt-submit.sh**: Inject micro-context only (< 200 chars)
• **stop.sh**: Auto-save session updates
• **pre-compact.sh**: Memory cleanup before context limit

### Technology Stack

• **Language**: Pure Bash (POSIX compliant)
• **Dependencies**: Zero (works out of the box)
• **Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows WSL
• **Integration**: Claude Code hooks
• **Storage**: Markdown files (human-readable, git-friendly)

## Performance Metrics
