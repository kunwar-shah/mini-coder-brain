## âœ… Action Items

### Immediate (Do Now)
- [ ] Read SESSION-START-EXPLAINED.md
- [ ] Understand why placeholders exist
- [ ] Learn how `/init-memory-bank` works

### Short-Term (This Week)
- [ ] Implement session-start refinements (Phase 1)
- [ ] Run `/init-memory-bank` on mini-coder-brain itself
- [ ] Test with real project

### Long-Term (This Month)
- [ ] Complete all 3 phases of refinements
- [ ] Document in main README
- [ ] Add to onboarding checklist

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Path

### Level 1: Understanding
**Goal**: Know how Mini-CoderBrain works

**Read**:
- SESSION-START-EXPLAINED.md (20 min)
- Key sections of PLACEHOLDER-FILLING-GUIDE.md (10 min)

**Expected Knowledge**:
- How session-start hook works
- Why placeholders exist
- What happens in real projects

---

### Level 2: Using
**Goal**: Install and use Mini-CoderBrain properly

**Read**:
- PLACEHOLDER-FILLING-GUIDE.md (30 min)
- REAL-WORLD-COMPARISON.md (15 min)

**Do**:
- Install Mini-CoderBrain in test project
- Run `/init-memory-bank`
- Verify placeholders are filled

**Expected Knowledge**:
- How to initialize memory bank
- What each memory file contains
- How to maintain context

---

### Level 3: Improving
**Goal**: Make Mini-CoderBrain better

**Read**:
- SESSION-START-REFINEMENTS.md (30 min)
- All previous docs (review)

**Do**:
- Implement Phase 1 refinements
- Test with multiple projects
- Document improvements

**Expected Knowledge**:
- What's wrong with current implementation
- How to optimize token usage
- How to improve user experience

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

### 1. Placeholders Are Temporary
Placeholders exist ONLY until `/init-memory-bank` runs. In production, users should NEVER see placeholders.

### 2. Mini-CoderBrain Is Special
It's a TOOL, not an APPLICATION. Its memory files are TEMPLATES that get copied to user projects.

### 3. We Should Dogfood
Mini-CoderBrain should use its own system properly. Fill our own placeholders!

### 4. Session-Start Needs Optimization
Current output is too verbose (400+ lines). Should be ~6 lines.

### 5. Context Loading â‰  Output
Files are loaded into context automatically. Hook doesn't need to output full contents.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### For Users
âœ… Placeholders filled in < 60 seconds
âœ… Boot status shows real project data
âœ… No confusing template text
âœ… Claude knows project context immediately

### For Mini-CoderBrain
âœ… Session-start outputs < 10 lines
âœ… Token usage reduced by 98% (8000 â†’ 120 tokens)
âœ… Professional appearance (no placeholders)
âœ… Clear guidance for uninitialized projects

## ðŸ’¡ Common Questions

### Q: Why do I see so many placeholders in session-start?
**A**: You're seeing Mini-CoderBrain's own memory files, which are templates. In real projects, `/init-memory-bank` fills these automatically.

### Q: How long does initialization take?
**A**: 60 seconds. Claude auto-detects tech stack and prompts for 3-4 quick questions.

### Q: Should Mini-CoderBrain fill its own placeholders?
**A**: YES! We should practice what we preach and use our own system properly.

### Q: What's the biggest issue with current session-start?
**A**: Too verbose (400+ lines). Should be ~6 lines with smart detection.

### Q: When should I run `/init-memory-bank`?
**A**: Immediately after installing Mini-CoderBrain in any project.
