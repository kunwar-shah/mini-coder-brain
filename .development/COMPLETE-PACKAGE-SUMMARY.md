## 🎯 Core Features Included

### 1. Universal Context Awareness ✅
- Auto-loads all memory bank files on session start
- Displays boot status with current focus, blockers, progress
- Works without any user prompting
- 100% universal - adapts to any project

### 2. Universal Project Detection ✅
- Detects 10+ common project patterns automatically
- Supports Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, PHP project types
- Creates `.claude/memory/project-structure.json`
- Fallback defaults for unknown structures

### 3. Persistent Memory ✅
- Memory bank files persist across all sessions
- Append-only updates with UTC timestamps
- Historical context never lost
- Manual sync via commands + auto-sync via hooks

### 4. 🚀 Micro-Context Flow (THE SILVER BULLET!) ✅
**Context injection on EVERY user prompt and AI response**

- **userPromptSubmit hook**: Detects intent, reads current state, injects micro-context
- **Stop hook**: Updates activeContext with session summary
- **Result**: AI ALWAYS knows current focus, development phase, and adapts guidance
- **Performance**: Zero latency (executes in milliseconds)

**Why this is revolutionary**:
- Session hooks work ONCE per session
- Micro-context flow works on EVERY interaction
- Perfect context continuity throughout entire session

### 5. Intelligent Notifications ✅
- Tracks session activity automatically
- Suggests `/memory-sync` after high-activity sessions (>5 operations)
- Context-aware suggestions based on development phase
- Non-intrusive, helpful guidance

### 6. Revolutionary Codebase Mapping ✅
- `/map-codebase` command for instant file access
- One-time build (~30 seconds), instant loading thereafter
- Surgical precision - no more searching for files
- Works with any project size

## 🚀 The Silver Bullet: Micro-Context Flow

**THIS IS THE GAME CHANGER**

Traditional approach:
- AI forgets context between responses
- Constant context repetition needed
- Context degrades over long sessions

Micro-context flow approach:
- ✅ AI receives fresh context on EVERY response
- ✅ Intent detection on every prompt
- ✅ Dynamic guidance based on current state
- ✅ Zero context repetition needed
- ✅ Perfect continuity throughout session

**Implemented via**:
- `userPromptSubmit` hook - Before AI generates response
- `stop` hook - After session ends
- `.claude/tmp/micro-context.md` - Context file created on every prompt
- `additionalContext` field - Injected into AI context automatically

## 📊 Command Hierarchy

### Real-Time Updates (During Session)
1. **`/context-update`** - Fast, targeted updates
   - Update focus: `/context-update focus "..."`
   - Add blocker: `/context-update blocker "..."`
   - Add priority: `/context-update priority "..."`
   - Record achievement: `/context-update achievement "..."`

### Comprehensive Sync (After Significant Work)
2. **`/memory-sync`** - Full memory bank analysis
   - Smart sync: `/memory-sync`
   - Full sync: `/memory-sync --full`
   - Quick sync: `/memory-sync --quick`

### Quick Manual Sync (Fast Note)
3. **`/umb "note"`** - Fastest way to preserve context
   - Example: `/umb "Completed auth feature"`

### Codebase Awareness
4. **`/map-codebase`** - Revolutionary file access
   - Build map: `/map-codebase --rebuild`
   - Load map: `/map-codebase`
