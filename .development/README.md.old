## 🛠 Core Features

### 1. Automatic Context Loading
Every session starts with full project awareness:
- Project overview and goals
- Current focus and blockers
- Recent progress and achievements
- Technical decisions made
- Coding standards and patterns

### 2. Universal Project Detection
Automatically detects:
- Frontend paths (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.)
- Backend paths (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, PHP, etc.)
- Database/migration paths
- Test directories
- Documentation locations

Saved to `.claude/memory/project-structure.json`

### 3. Persistent Memory
Everything is remembered:
- Development progress
- Technical decisions
- Current blockers
- Project patterns
- Session history

### 4. 🚀 Micro-Context Flow (THE SILVER BULLET!)
**The game changer** - Context injection on **EVERY user prompt and AI response**.

Unlike session start/stop hooks (once per session), micro-context flow provides:
- ✅ **Intent detection** - Analyzes every prompt (debugging, feature dev, testing, etc.)
- ✅ **Current state awareness** - Reads activeContext.md before each response
- ✅ **Dynamic guidance** - AI receives context-specific guidance
- ✅ **Zero latency** - Executes in milliseconds via hooks
- ✅ **Perfect continuity** - Never loses context throughout session

**How it works**:
1. You type: "Fix the authentication bug"
2. **BEFORE Response** - `userPromptSubmit` hook:
   - Detects intent: "debugging"
   - Reads current focus from activeContext.md
   - Reads project paths from project-structure.json
   - Creates `.claude/tmp/micro-context.md` with debugging guidance
   - Injects as `additionalContext` to AI
3. **AI Response**: Receives micro-context, responds with full awareness
4. **AFTER Response** - `stop` hook:
   - Counts operations performed
   - Updates activeContext.md with session summary
   - Logs completion timestamp
   - Suggests memory sync if needed

**Result**: Complete before + after cycle on EVERY interaction. AI always knows what you're working on, what phase you're in, and adapts accordingly.

### 5. Smart Notifications
Get intelligent suggestions:
- Memory sync reminders after productive sessions
- Context update prompts when significant work is done
- Non-intrusive, context-aware suggestions

### 6. 📚 Reference Rules System (Token-Efficient!)
**Brilliant solution to "Prompt too long"**: Rules files provide guidance WITHOUT bloating context!

**How it works**:
- Rules live in `.claude/rules/` folder
- AI reads them **when needed**, not every prompt
- CLAUDE.md controller references them with `@.claude/rules/filename.md`
- Result: Perfect guidance with ZERO token overhead

**Available rules**:
- **token-efficiency.md** - Size limits, injection rules, anti-patterns
- **coding-standards.md** - Language-specific best practices, security, testing
- **context-management.md** - Memory bank maintenance, cleanup schedules

**Philosophy**:
- **Active Context** (micro-context): Minimal, injected every prompt
- **Reference Rules**: Comprehensive, read on demand only
- **Best of both worlds**: Perfect guidance without token bloat!

## 📋 Essential Commands

### `/map-codebase`
Revolutionary instant file access system.

**Usage**:
```bash
# First time - build the map (~30 seconds)
/map-codebase --rebuild

# After that - instant loading
/map-codebase

# Focus on recent changes only
/map-codebase --recent
```

**Benefit**: No more "find this file" or "search for that function" - surgical precision file access.

### `/memory-sync`
Full memory bank synchronization - comprehensive context preservation.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Smart sync based on session activity
/memory-sync

# Full synchronization (all memory files)
/memory-sync --full

# Quick sync (activeContext only)
/memory-sync --quick
```

**Benefit**: Ensures all memory files reflect current project state with full session analysis.

### `/context-update`
Real-time context updates - fast, targeted updates to active context.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Update current focus
/context-update focus "Implementing payment processing"

# Add new blocker
/context-update blocker "API rate limiting needs caching"

# Add new priority
/context-update priority "Write integration tests"

# Record achievement
/context-update achievement "Completed auth with 100% test coverage"

# Interactive mode
/context-update
```

**Benefit**: Keep context current throughout session with targeted, timestamped updates.

### `/umb "note"`
Quick manual sync - fast memory bank update with note.

**Usage**:
```bash
# After completing a feature
/umb "Completed authentication system with JWT tokens"

# After making a technical decision
/umb "Decided to use PostgreSQL for better JSON support"

# After hitting a blocker
/umb "Blocked on API rate limiting - need to implement caching"
```

**Benefit**: Fastest way to preserve context with a note.

## 🔧 Customization

### For Your Project
Edit `.claude/memory/` files to add project-specific details:

1. **productContext.md** - Project overview, features, tech stack
2. **activeContext.md** - Current focus and priorities
3. **progress.md** - Development milestones
4. **systemPatterns.md** - Coding standards and conventions
5. **decisionLog.md** - Technical decisions (ADRs)

### For Unusual Project Structures
Edit `.claude/memory/project-structure.json` if auto-detection doesn't match your structure:

```json
{
  "detected_paths": {
    "frontend": "your-frontend-path",
    "backend": "your-backend-path",
    "migrations": "your-migrations-path"
  }
}
```

---

## 💡 Daily Workflow

### Morning (Session Start)
1. Open Claude Code
2. See boot status with current focus
3. Check recent progress and blockers
4. Start working with full context

### During Development
- Work normally - Claude has full project awareness
- Make changes, write code, solve problems
- Context flows automatically

### Evening (Session End)
1. Session auto-syncs to activeContext.md
2. For significant work: `/umb "what you accomplished"`
3. Close Claude Code
4. Context is preserved for next session

## 🎯 What Problems Does This Solve?

### ❌ Before Mini-CoderBrain
- "What were we working on last session?"
- "Where is the authentication code?"
- "What did we decide about the database?"
- "Let me search for that file again..."
- Repeat context every session

### ✅ After Mini-CoderBrain
- Full context loaded automatically every session
- Instant file access with codebase mapping
- Technical decisions preserved in decision log
- Progress tracked across all sessions
- Zero context repetition needed

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Prompt is too long" Error After 15-20 Minutes?

**Cause**: Micro-context injection on every prompt accumulates tokens.

**Solution**: The hook automatically skips injection if context > 1000 characters. If still occurring:

1. **Temporary Fix** - Disable UserPromptSubmit hook:
```json
// In .claude/settings.json, comment out:
// "UserPromptSubmit": [...]
```

2. **Reduce Context Size** - Edit memory bank files to be more concise

3. **Clear Conversation** - Start fresh conversation to reset token usage

**Note**: Mini-CoderBrain v1.0 includes smart injection limits to prevent this issue.

### Hooks Not Running?
```bash
# Make hooks executable
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### Context Not Loading?
1. Check `.claude/memory/` files exist
2. Verify CLAUDE.md is in project root
3. Check Claude Code hooks are enabled in settings

### Project Structure Wrong?
Edit `.claude/memory/project-structure.json` manually with correct paths.

### Stop Hook JSON Error?
Check `.claude/hooks/optimized-intelligent-stop.sh` outputs valid JSON only.
