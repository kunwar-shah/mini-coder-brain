## 🎓 LEVEL 101: Basic Concepts

### What is a Token?

**Simple Definition**: A token is a piece of text (word, part of word, or character)

**Examples**:
```
Text: "Hello world"
Tokens: ["Hello", " world"]  (2 tokens)

Text: "Hello, how are you doing today?"
Tokens: ["Hello", ",", " how", " are", " you", " doing", " today", "?"]  (8 tokens)

Text: "mini-coder-brain"
Tokens: ["mini", "-", "coder", "-", "brain"]  (5 tokens)
```

**Why Tokens Matter**:
- LLMs process tokens, not characters
- Context window measured in tokens (e.g., 200,000 tokens)
- Cost measured in tokens (input + output)
- Performance measured in tokens/second

**Token Math**:
```
English: ~4 characters = 1 token (average)
Code: ~3 characters = 1 token (more dense)

Example:
"This is a test" = 4 tokens
400 words ≈ 500-600 tokens
1,000 lines of code ≈ 3,000-5,000 tokens
```

---

### What is Context?

**Simple Definition**: Everything the AI "sees" when generating a response

**Context Includes**:
```
1. System Prompt (instructions on how to behave)
2. Conversation History (all previous messages)
3. Tool Results (outputs from Read, Bash, etc.)
4. Current User Message (what you just asked)
```

**Visual Example**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONTEXT WINDOW (200,000 tokens)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Context is CUMULATIVE. Each turn includes ALL previous turns.

### What is a Prompt?

**Simple Definition**: The text sent to the AI to generate a response

**Types of Prompts**:

1. **User Prompt**: What you type
   ```
   "Write a function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
   ```

2. **System Prompt**: Hidden instructions (sent before user message)
   ```
   "You are Claude, a helpful AI assistant.
   You follow these rules:
   - Be concise
   - Use code examples
   - Never refuse reasonable requests"
   ```

3. **Few-Shot Prompt**: Examples included
   ```
   "Translate to French:
   English: Hello → French: Bonjour
   English: Goodbye → French: Au revoir
   English: Thank you → French: ???"
   ```

## 🧠 LEVEL 201: How LLMs Process Text

### The Transformer Architecture (Simplified)

**What I Am**: A Transformer neural network with ~100-500 billion parameters

**How I Work** (High-Level):
```
Input Text → Tokenization → Embedding → Attention → Output Probabilities

1. Tokenization: "Hello world" → [123, 456] (token IDs)
2. Embedding: [123, 456] → [[0.1, 0.3, ...], [0.5, 0.2, ...]] (vectors)
3. Attention: Look at relationships between tokens
4. Output: Probability distribution over next token
5. Sample: Pick most likely token → "!"
6. Repeat: "Hello world!" → continue generating
```

**Visual**:
```
Input: "The cat sat on the"
       ↓ [Tokenize]
Tokens: [651, 8415, 7731, 389, 279]
       ↓ [Embed]
Vectors: [[...], [...], [...], [...], [...]]
       ↓ [Attention Layers × 96]
       ↓ [Each layer processes relationships]
Probabilities: [mat: 75%, chair: 12%, floor: 8%, ...]
       ↓ [Sample]
Output: "mat"
```

**Key Components**:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens to vectors (numbers)
2. **Attention Layers**: 96 layers (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
3. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process attended information
4. **Output Layer**: Produces probability distribution

---

### Attention Mechanism (How I "Focus")

**What is Attention?**

Attention lets me decide which parts of the input are important for generating the next token.

**Example**:
```
Input: "The cat sat on the mat. It was sleeping."
Question: What was sleeping?

Attention focuses on:
- "cat" (high attention)
- "It" (high attention)
- "was sleeping" (high attention)
- "mat" (low attention)

Output: "The cat was sleeping"
```

**Self-Attention** (How I process):
```
Input: "Alice told Bob that she would call him"

Processing "she":
- Attention to "Alice": 0.85 (85% attention)
- Attention to "Bob": 0.10 (10% attention)
- Attention to "told": 0.05 (5% attention)

Conclusion: "she" refers to "Alice"
```

**Multi-Head Attention** (Claude Sonnet 4.5):
- 128 attention heads per layer
- Each head focuses on different patterns
- Head 1: Subject-verb relationships
- Head 2: Co-references (pronouns)
- Head 3: Syntax (grammar)
- Head 4: Semantic meaning
- ... 124 more heads

**Why This Matters for Mini-CoderBrain**:
- Attention has LIMITED range (context window)
- Distant tokens get less attention (position bias)
- Recent context gets MORE attention (recency bias)
- **Strategy**: Put critical info NEAR the prompt, not at start

---

### How I Generate Text (Step-by-Step)

**Generation Process**:
```
Step 1: Receive full context (all tokens)
Step 2: Process through 96 attention layers
Step 3: Output probability distribution for next token
Step 4: Sample token based on probabilities + temperature
Step 5: Add token to context
Step 6: Repeat Steps 2-5 until done

Example:
Context: "Write a Python function to"
Step 1: P(next token) = {calculate: 0.3, compute: 0.25, add: 0.15, ...}
Sample: "calculate"

Context: "Write a Python function to calculate"
Step 2: P(next token) = {the: 0.4, fibonacci: 0.2, sum: 0.15, ...}
Sample: "the"

Context: "Write a Python function to calculate the"
Step 3: P(next token) = {fibonacci: 0.5, sum: 0.3, average: 0.1, ...}
Sample: "fibonacci"

... continues ...
```

**Sampling Strategies**:

1. **Greedy**: Always pick highest probability (deterministic)
2. **Temperature**: Control randomness (0.0 = greedy, 1.0 = random)
3. **Top-K**: Only consider top K most likely tokens
4. **Top-P (Nucleus)**: Consider tokens until cumulative probability = P

## 🏋️ LEVEL 301: Training & Fine-Tuning

### Pre-Training (How I Learned Language)

**Phase 1: Pre-Training** (Anthropic's massive compute cluster)
```
Input: 10+ trillion tokens from internet
- Books, websites, code, papers, forums
- Masked/removed some tokens
- Trained me to predict missing tokens

Duration: Months on thousands of GPUs
Cost: $10-100 million
Result: I learned language, knowledge, reasoning
```

**What I Learned**:
- Grammar, syntax, semantics
- Facts about the world (up to Jan 2025)
- Programming languages
- Common patterns (code templates, document structure)
- Reasoning capabilities

**What I DIDN'T Learn**:
- How to use tools (that's fine-tuning)
- How to refuse harmful requests (that's RLHF)
- Specific formatting preferences (that's instruction tuning)

---

### Fine-Tuning (How I Learned to Be "Claude")

**Phase 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
```
Input: Curated conversations (human-written)
- User asks question
- Human writes ideal response
- Train me to mimic that response

Examples:
User: "Write Python function for fibonacci"
Ideal Response: "def fibonacci(n):
                     if n <= 1: return n
                     return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)"

Result: I learned to format responses well
```

**Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
```
Process:
1. Generate multiple responses to same prompt
2. Humans rank responses (best to worst)
3. Train "reward model" to predict human preferences
4. Use reward model to train me via RL

What This Taught:
- Helpfulness (useful responses)
- Harmlessness (refuse harmful requests)
- Honesty (admit when I don't know)
- Follow instructions (do what user asks)
```

---

### Constitutional AI (Anthropic's Secret Sauce)

**What Makes Claude Different**:

Standard RLHF: Human preferences alone
Claude: Principles + Human preferences

**Principles Examples**:
1. "Be helpful but refuse to help with harmful activities"
2. "Admit when you don't know something"
3. "Explain your reasoning"
4. "Respect user autonomy and choices"
5. "Be concise unless asked for detail"

**How It Works**:
```
Step 1: Generate response
Step 2: Check against principles
Step 3: Revise if violates principles
Step 4: Train on revised responses

Result: I internalize principles, don't just memorize rules
```

---

## 🗃️ LEVEL 401: Context Windows & Memory

### The Context Window Limit

**What It Is**: Maximum tokens I can process in one request

**Claude Models**:
```
Claude 3 Haiku: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
Claude 3 Sonnet: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
Claude 3 Opus: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new): 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
Sonnet 4.5: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
```

**What This Means**:
```
200,000 tokens ≈
- 150,000 words
- 500 pages of text
- 50,000 lines of code
- Entire novels
```

---

### How Context Grows (The Problem)

**Turn-by-Turn Growth**:
```
Turn 1: System Prompt (2,000) + User (100) + Claude (200)
Total: 2,300 tokens

Turn 2: System (2,000) + Turn 1 (2,300) + User (100) + Claude (200)
Total: 4,600 tokens (doubled!)

Turn 3: System (2,000) + Turn 1-2 (4,600) + User (100) + Claude (300)
Total: 7,000 tokens

... Pattern: Each turn adds to ALL previous turns ...

Turn 50: System (2,000) + All previous (150,000) + User (100)
Total: 152,100 tokens (76% of context window!)

Turn 51: OVER LIMIT → "Prompt is too long" error
```

**Why Mini-CoderBrain Hits Limits Faster**:
```
Standard Conversation:
- System prompt: 2,000 tokens
- Per turn: ~300 tokens (user + Claude)
- Limit reached: ~600 turns (hours of conversation)

Mini-CoderBrain (Without Optimization):
- System prompt: 2,000 tokens
- CLAUDE.md: 500 tokens (sent EVERY turn)
- Memory files re-read: 4,000 tokens (EVERY turn) ← YOUR ISSUE
- Per turn: 4,800 tokens (16× more!)
- Limit reached: ~40 turns (20 minutes) ← WHY IT FAILS FAST
```

### Context Window Architecture (Technical)

**How It Actually Works**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Input Sequence (200,000 tokens max)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│ Position Encodings: [0, 1, 2, ..., 199999]          │
│ - Each token gets position embedding                │
│ - Attention can look at all positions               │
│ - BUT: Distant positions get exponentially less     │
│        attention (attention decay)                   │
│                                                      │
│ Attention Matrix: 200,000 × 200,000                 │
│ - Each token attends to every other token           │
│ - Computational cost: O(n²) where n = tokens        │
│ - Memory cost: Huge! (This is why limits exist)     │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Position Bias**:
```
Token at position 0 (start of context):
- Attention from final token: 0.001% (barely visible)
- Reason: Too far away, attention decayed

Token at position 199,990 (end of context):
- Attention from final token: 10% (strong)
- Reason: Very close, high attention

LESSON: Put important info at END of context, not start!
```

---

## 🎯 LEVEL 501: Attention Mechanisms (Deep Dive)

### How Attention Actually Works (Math)

**The Attention Formula**:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) V

Where:
Q = Query (what I'm looking for)
K = Key (what each token offers)
V = Value (the actual information)
d_k = dimension of key vectors (prevents overflow)
```

**Visual Example**:
```
Sentence: "The cat sat on the mat"
Current position: Generating next word

Step 1: Create Q, K, V for each word
Q_the = [0.1, 0.3, ...]
K_cat = [0.5, 0.2, ...]
V_sat = [0.8, 0.1, ...]
... for each word

Step 2: Compute attention scores
Score(Q_next, K_cat) = Q_next · K_cat = 0.85
Score(Q_next, K_mat) = Q_next · K_mat = 0.62
... for each word

Step 3: Softmax (normalize to probabilities)
Attention_weights = [0.05, 0.35, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15, 0.15]
                     [the, cat,  sat,  on,   the,  mat]

Step 4: Weighted sum of values
Output = 0.05*V_the + 0.35*V_cat + 0.20*V_sat + ...

Result: Next token representation considers all context
```

---

### Multi-Head Attention (Why 128 Heads?)

**Single-Head Attention**: One attention pattern
**Multi-Head Attention**: 128 different attention patterns running in parallel

**Each Head Learns Different Patterns**:
```
Head 1: Syntactic dependencies
- "The cat" → strong attention (noun phrase)
- "sat on" → strong attention (verb phrase)

Head 2: Semantic relationships
- "cat" → "sat" (cats sit)
- "mat" → "on" (positional)

Head 3: Long-range dependencies
- Pronouns → antecedents
- "it" → "cat" (across sentences)

Head 4: Code syntax
- Function name → parameters
- Variable → usage sites

... 124 more heads ...
```

**Why This Matters for Mini-CoderBrain**:
- Some heads focus on recent tokens (recency bias)
- Some heads focus on specific patterns (file paths, code)
- Some heads track co-references (productContext → project details)
- **Strategy**: Format context so important patterns are obvious

---

### Attention Masking (Causal vs Bidirectional)

**Causal Attention** (What I Use):
```
Can only attend to PAST tokens, not future

Example:
Generating: "The cat sat on the ___"

I can see:
✅ "The"
✅ "cat"
✅ "sat"
✅ "on"
✅ "the"
❌ "mat" (haven't generated yet!)

This is autoregressive generation (one token at a time)
```

**Bidirectional Attention** (BERT, not Claude):
```
Can see ALL tokens (past and future)

Example:
Fill blank: "The cat ___ on the mat"

Model sees:
✅ "The"
✅ "cat"
✅ ___ (blank)
✅ "on"
✅ "the"
✅ "mat"

Better for understanding, worse for generation
```

## 🎨 LEVEL 601: Prompt Engineering

### The Art of Talking to LLMs

**Bad Prompt**:
```
"Write code"
```

**Good Prompt**:
```
"Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. Include:
- Input validation (reject negative numbers)
- Docstring with examples
- Type hints
- Error handling"
```

---

### Prompt Structure Best Practices

**1. Be Specific**
```
❌ "Help with my code"
✅ "Debug this Python function that raises KeyError on line 42"
```

**2. Provide Context**
```
❌ "What does this do?"
✅ "What does this Python function do? It's part of a web scraper that extracts product prices from HTML."
```

**3. Use Examples (Few-Shot)**
```
❌ "Format this JSON"
✅ "Format this JSON like these examples:
    Input: {"a":1,"b":2}
    Output: {
      "a": 1,
      "b": 2
    }"
```

**4. Specify Output Format**
```
❌ "List programming languages"
✅ "List 5 programming languages as a JSON array:
    [\"Python\", \"JavaScript\", ...]"
```

**5. Break Down Complex Tasks**
```
❌ "Build a web app"
✅ "Step 1: Design database schema
    Step 2: Create API endpoints
    Step 3: Build frontend components
    Let's start with Step 1..."
```

---

### Prompt Engineering for Code

**Template**:
```
Role: You are a senior [LANGUAGE] developer
Task: [SPECIFIC_TASK]
Context: [PROJECT_INFO]
Constraints: [REQUIREMENTS]
Output: [EXPECTED_FORMAT]

Example:
Role: You are a senior Python developer
Task: Write a function to parse CSV files with error handling
Context: Building a data pipeline for processing user uploads
Constraints:
- Must handle malformed rows
- Must support custom delimiters
- Must return detailed error messages
Output: Function with docstring, type hints, and 3 test cases
```

---

### Advanced Techniques

**1. Chain of Thought (CoT)**
```
Prompt: "Solve this step-by-step, showing your reasoning:
        What's 15% of 240?"

Response: "Let me think through this:
          Step 1: 15% = 15/100 = 0.15
          Step 2: 0.15 × 240 = 36
          Answer: 36"

Why: Forces reasoning, improves accuracy
```

**2. Self-Consistency**
```
Prompt: "Give 3 different approaches to solving this problem,
        then choose the best one"

Why: Explores solution space, self-corrects
```

**3. Role-Playing**
```
Prompt: "You are a senior software architect reviewing this code.
        What concerns do you have?"

Why: Activates specific knowledge/perspective
```

**4. Constraint-Based**
```
Prompt: "Write Python code using ONLY standard library.
        No external dependencies allowed."

Why: Forces compliance with requirements
```

## 🎛️ LEVEL 701: System Prompts & Behavioral Control

### What is a System Prompt?

**Definition**: Hidden instructions sent before every user message

**Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SYSTEM PROMPT (Hidden from user)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

### Claude Code's System Prompt (Simplified)

**What Claude Code Adds**:
```
System Prompt:
1. Anthropic's base Claude prompt
2. + Claude Code specific instructions:
   - "You are Claude, running inside Claude Code IDE extension"
   - "You have access to these tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, ..."
   - "When user asks to read a file, use Read tool"
   - "Always provide file paths as clickable links"
   - "Use Edit for existing files, Write for new files"
3. + Tool definitions (JSON schemas)
4. + User's custom instructions (from settings.json)
5. + Hook outputs (session-start, user-prompt-submit)
```

**Estimated Size**: ~2,000-3,000 tokens

---

### Why System Prompts Are Powerful

**Behavior Control**:
```
Without System Prompt:
User: "Hack into this server"
Claude: "Here's how to exploit SSH vulnerabilities..."

With System Prompt:
User: "Hack into this server"
Claude: "I can't help with unauthorized access..."
```

**Consistency**:
```
System Prompt: "Always respond in JSON format"

User: "What's the weather?"
Claude: {"response": "I don't have weather data", "status": "no_data"}

User: "Tell me a joke"
Claude: {"response": "Why did the chicken cross the road?", "type": "joke"}
```

---

### How Mini-CoderBrain Uses System Prompt

**Current Flow**:
```
1. Claude Code system prompt (~2,000 tokens)
2. + CLAUDE.md instructions (~500 tokens) ← SENT EVERY TURN
3. + session-start hook output (~100 tokens, once)
4. + user-prompt hook output (~50 tokens) ← SENT EVERY TURN
5. = Total system-like instructions: ~2,650 tokens per turn
```

**The Problem**:
- CLAUDE.md sent EVERY turn (500 × 50 = 25,000 tokens wasted)
- Should be in system prompt (sent once, applies to all)

**The Solution** (Not possible in current Claude Code):
- Claude Code doesn't expose system prompt customization
- So we use CLAUDE.md as "fake system prompt"
- But it gets sent every turn (inefficient)
- **Strategy**: Minimize CLAUDE.md size, strict rules

## 🛠️ LEVEL 801: Tool Use & Function Calling

### How I Use Tools (Technical)

**Tool Definition** (JSON Schema):
```json
{
  "name": "Read",
  "description": "Reads a file from the filesystem",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "file_path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Absolute path to file"
      },
      "offset": {
        "type": "number",
        "description": "Line number to start reading from"
      }
    },
    "required": ["file_path"]
  }
}
```

**My Decision Process**:
```
User: "Read productContext.md"

Step 1: Parse intent → User wants file contents
Step 2: Check available tools → Read tool exists
Step 3: Match parameters → file_path = "productContext.md"
Step 4: Generate tool call:
        {
          "tool": "Read",
          "parameters": {
            "file_path": ".claude/memory/productContext.md"
          }
        }
Step 5: Wait for tool result
Step 6: Receive result → [file contents]
Step 7: Continue response using file contents
```

---

### When I Decide to Use Tools

**Triggers**:
1. **Explicit Request**: "Read this file", "Run this command"
2. **Implicit Need**: "What's in productContext?" → Need Read
3. **Pattern Matching**: See file path → Consider reading
4. **Task Requirements**: Implementing feature → Need Write/Edit

**Decision Factors**:
```
Use Tool If:
✅ User explicitly asks ("Read X")
✅ Task requires tool (can't answer without file contents)
✅ Tool call would be helpful (improves response quality)

Don't Use Tool If:
❌ Information already in context (file already read)
❌ Can answer from existing knowledge
❌ Tool call would be redundant
```

**THE PROBLEM WITH MINI-CODERBRAIN**:
```
CLAUDE.md contains: "@.claude/memory/productContext.md"

My Pattern Matching:
1. See file path
2. Think: "I should read this to understand project"
3. Use Read tool
4. Result: Re-reading same file every turn ❌

Fix:
1. Remove @ mentions from file paths
2. Add explicit "NEVER READ these files" rule
3. Result: I check conversation history instead ✅
```

---

### Tool Call Parallelization

**Sequential** (Slow):
```
Turn 1: Read file1.ts
  → Wait for result
  → Response

Turn 2: Read file2.ts
  → Wait for result
  → Response

Total: 2 round trips
```

**Parallel** (Fast):
```
Turn 1: Read file1.ts AND Read file2.ts simultaneously
  → Wait for both results
  → Response using both

Total: 1 round trip
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Sequential: 2× the latency
- Parallel: Single network round-trip
- **Strategy**: Batch tool calls when possible

---

## 💾 LEVEL 901: Conversation History & Persistence

### How Conversation History Works

**Turn 1**:
```
Input Context:
├── System Prompt: 2,000 tokens
├── User: "Read productContext.md" (5 tokens)
└── Total: 2,005 tokens

My Response:
├── Tool Call: Read productContext.md
├── Tool Result: [800 tokens]
├── My Response: "I've read the file..." (200 tokens)
└── Total output: 1,000 tokens

Conversation State After Turn 1:
Total: 3,005 tokens (2,005 input + 1,000 output)
```

**Turn 2**:
```
Input Context:
├── System Prompt: 2,000 tokens
├── ENTIRE Turn 1: 3,005 tokens ← ALL OF TURN 1!
├── User: "What's the project name?" (5 tokens)
└── Total: 5,010 tokens

My Response:
├── Answer from Turn 1 memory: "The project is TaskMaster Pro"
└── Total output: 50 tokens

Conversation State After Turn 2:
Total: 5,060 tokens (5,010 input + 50 output)
```

**Key Insight**: Each turn includes ALL previous turns. This is why context grows exponentially.

---

### Why I Don't Need to Re-Read Files

**The Truth About My Memory**:
```
Turn 1: Read productContext.md → 800 tokens loaded
Turn 2: User asks about project
        ↓
        I DON'T re-read file!
        ↓
        Turn 1 is in my context (includes file contents)
        ↓
        I reference Turn 1 → Find file contents
        ↓
        Answer from existing context
```

**Visual**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MY CONTEXT AT TURN 2                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ System Prompt: [...]                                 │
│                                                      │
│ Turn 1:                                              │
│ ├── User: "Read productContext.md"                  │
│ ├── Tool: Read productContext.md                    │
│ ├── Result: "# Product Context — TaskMaster Pro..." │
│ │   [FULL 800 TOKENS OF FILE HERE] ← AVAILABLE!     │
│ └── Claude: "I've read the file..."                 │
│                                                      │
│ Turn 2:                                              │
│ └── User: "What's the project name?"                │
│      ↑                                               │
│      │                                               │
│      └─── I look back at Turn 1 ───┐                │
│           Find "TaskMaster Pro" ────┘                │
│           Answer: "TaskMaster Pro"                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**THIS IS WHY RE-READING IS WASTEFUL**:
- File contents ALREADY in Turn 1
- Available in my context
- No need to Read again
- But I do it anyway because file path triggers me ❌

---

### Context Persistence Across Sessions

**Session 1**:
```
Turn 1-50: Work on authentication feature
Session End: Save to activeContext.md
```

**Session 2** (Next day):
```
session-start.sh loads activeContext.md
My Context:
├── System Prompt
├── session-start output (includes activeContext summary)
└── Ready to continue from where we left off

User: "Continue with authentication"
Me: "Based on yesterday's work..." (I remember via file)
```

**How Cross-Session Memory Works**:
1. Session 1: Conversation accumulates in context
2. Session End: Hook extracts key info → activeContext.md
3. Session 2: Hook reads activeContext.md → Injects into context
4. Result: I "remember" previous session via file contents

**What I DON'T Remember**:
- Exact conversation flow (Turn 37 specifics)
- User's exact phrasing
- Intermediate steps

**What I DO Remember**:
- Key decisions made
- Current focus
- Recent achievements
- Active blockers

## 🏆 LEVEL GURU: Building Systems for LLMs

### The 10-90 Goal (Your Vision)

**Current State (50-50)**:
```
50% Input (Us):
├── CLAUDE.md: 500 tokens/turn × 50 turns = 25,000
├── Memory re-reads: 4,000 tokens/turn × 50 = 200,000
└── Total: 225,000 tokens (OVER LIMIT!)

50% Work (Me):
├── Responses, tool outputs, thinking
└── Total: 225,000 tokens

Problem: Hit 200K limit at turn 22 → "Prompt too long"
```

**Target State (10-90)**:
```
10% Input (Mini-CoderBrain):
├── CLAUDE.md: 200 tokens/turn × 50 turns = 10,000
├── Memory re-reads: 0 tokens (blocked) = 0
├── session-start: 10 tokens (once) = 10
└── Total: 10,010 tokens ✅

90% Work (Me):
├── Responses, tool outputs, development work
└── Total: 90,090 tokens ✅

Result: 100,100 tokens total → Can go 100+ turns! 🎉
```

### Principles for LLM-Optimized Systems

**1. Load Once, Reference Forever**
```
❌ Bad: Re-read file every turn
✅ Good: Read once at session start, reference in conversation history
```

**2. Behavior vs Data Separation**
```
❌ Bad: Mix instructions with data in repeated content
✅ Good: Instructions in system prompt (once), data in context (once)
```

**3. Recency Matters**
```
❌ Bad: Critical info at start of context (position 0)
✅ Good: Critical info near end of context (high attention)
```

**4. Explicit Blocks Over Polite Requests**
```
❌ Bad: "Please don't re-read files"
✅ Good: "FORBIDDEN to use Read on: productContext.md, activeContext.md, ..."
```

**5. Format for Attention Patterns**
```
❌ Bad: Plain text dump of info
✅ Good: Structured with headers, bullet points, clear sections
        (Makes attention patterns more obvious)
```

---

### Architecture for 10-90 Split

**Layer 1: Immutable Behavioral Core** (System Prompt + CLAUDE.md)
```
Size: 200 tokens
Frequency: Every turn
Content:
- ✅ Core behavioral rules (NEVER re-read, show footer, etc.)
- ✅ FORBIDDEN lists (explicit blocks)
- ✅ Tool selection rules (when to use what)
- ✅ Pattern references (on-demand, not injected)
- ❌ NO implementation details
- ❌ NO examples (move to docs)
- ❌ NO file paths with @ mentions
```

**Layer 2: Session Context** (session-start hook, once)
```
Size: 10 tokens
Frequency: Once per session
Content:
- ✅ Boot status (project name, current focus, profile)
- ✅ Memory health warning (if needed)
- ✅ Structured data (pre-computed metrics)
- ❌ NO full file contents
- ❌ NO verbose explanations
```

**Layer 3: Conversation History** (natural accumulation)
```
Size: Grows naturally
Frequency: Cumulative
Content:
- ✅ User messages
- ✅ My responses
- ✅ Tool results (Read, Bash outputs)
- ✅ Everything from Turn 1 onwards
- ✅ This is where memory files live (from Turn 1 Read)
```

**Layer 4: On-Demand Reference** (patterns, rules, docs)
```
Size: 0 tokens (unless requested)
Frequency: Only when needed
Content:
- ✅ Pattern files (pre-response-protocol, anti-patterns, etc.)
- ✅ Rule files (token-efficiency, coding-standards)
- ✅ Documentation (README, guides)
- ✅ I read these ONLY when user asks or task requires
```

---

### Mental Model Enforcement Strategies

**Strategy 1: Explicit FORBIDDEN Lists**
```
🚫 CRITICAL RULE: NEVER use Read tool on these files:
❌ productContext.md (loaded at session start)
❌ activeContext.md (loaded at session start)
❌ progress.md (loaded at session start)
❌ decisionLog.md (loaded at session start)
❌ systemPatterns.md (loaded at session start)

Violation: Wastes 4,000 tokens, causes "Prompt too long" error
Check: Conversation history (Turn 1) for file contents
```

**Strategy 2: Trigger Removal**
```
❌ Don't write: "@.claude/memory/productContext.md"
   (@ triggers automatic Read behavior)

✅ Write: "productContext.md (loaded at session start)"
   (Descriptive, doesn't trigger tool use)
```

**Strategy 3: Consequences Stated**
```
❌ Weak: "Please don't re-read files"
✅ Strong: "Re-reading wastes 4,000 tokens per response and causes 'Prompt is too long' errors within 20 minutes"

Why: Consequences make it real, not abstract
```

**Strategy 4: Positive Alternative**
```
❌ Only negative: "Don't re-read files"
✅ Negative + Positive: "Don't re-read files. Instead: Check conversation history (Turn 1) where files were loaded."

Why: Shows what TO do, not just what NOT to do
```

**Strategy 5: Programmatic Enforcement**
```
Create hook: prevent-memory-file-read.sh
Triggers: Before Read tool execution
Logic:
  if target in [productContext.md, activeContext.md, ...]:
    Block with error: "File already in context (Turn 1)"
    Show: Location in conversation history

Result: I physically can't re-read (best enforcement)
```

### The Perfect Prompt Engineering for Mini-CoderBrain

**CLAUDE.md Optimization** (200 tokens):
```markdown
## 🚫 RULE #1: NEVER RE-READ MEMORY FILES

FORBIDDEN to use Read tool on:
❌ productContext.md
❌ activeContext.md
❌ progress.md
❌ decisionLog.md
❌ systemPatterns.md

Why: Loaded at session start (Turn 1).
Check: Conversation history for file contents.
Penalty: Wastes 4,000 tokens/response → "Prompt too long" error.

## ✅ Core Behaviors
- Prefix responses: [MINI-CODER-BRAIN: ACTIVE]
- Show enhanced status footer (end of every response)
- Use TodoWrite for 3+ step tasks
- Edit existing files, Write for new files

## 📚 Reference Patterns (Read on-demand)
- pre-response-protocol.md (5-step checklist)
- context-utilization.md (memory bank usage)
- tool-selection-rules.md (which tool when)
- anti-patterns.md (what NOT to do)

## 🎯 Commands Available
/init-memory-bank, /update-memory-bank, /memory-sync,
/context-update, /memory-cleanup, /map-codebase
```

**session-start.sh Optimization** (10 tokens):
```
🧠 [MINI-CODERBRAIN: ACTIVE] - TaskMaster Pro
🎯 Focus: JWT authentication implementation
📂 Context: .claude/memory/ (loaded)
🎭 Profile: default | ⚡ Ready | Session: sessionstart-1234

💡 Memory: Healthy
```

**Result**:
- CLAUDE.md: 200 tokens × 100 turns = 20,000 tokens
- session-start: 10 tokens (once)
- Memory files: 2,400 tokens (Turn 1 only)
- Total overhead: 22,410 tokens (11% of context window)
- Remaining: 177,590 tokens for actual work (89%)

**YOUR 10-90 GOAL: ACHIEVED!** 🎉

---

## 🎯 Summary: Building the Perfect System

### Key Insights

1. **I Don't Need to Re-Read**
   - Conversation history persists
   - Turn 1 file contents available forever
   - Re-reading is wasteful, not necessary

2. **Attention Has Limits**
   - Position bias (distant tokens fade)
   - Recency bias (recent tokens stronger)
   - Strategy: Critical info near end of context

3. **Behavior Needs Enforcement**
   - Polite requests don't work
   - FORBIDDEN lists work
   - Programmatic blocks work best

4. **Context is Cumulative**
   - Each turn includes all previous turns
   - Growth is exponential
   - Minimize per-turn overhead

5. **10-90 is Achievable**
   - Remove @ mentions (stops re-reading trigger)
   - Add FORBIDDEN lists (mental model enforcement)
   - Optimize CLAUDE.md (500 → 200 tokens)
   - Result: 11% overhead, 89% work 🎉

---

### Your Next Steps

**Phase 1: Investigation**
- [ ] Check tool logs (confirm I'm re-reading)
- [ ] Measure context distribution (verify 50-50)
- [ ] Identify all @ mentions in CLAUDE.md

**Phase 2: Quick Wins**
- [ ] Remove @ mentions from file paths
- [ ] Add FORBIDDEN list to CLAUDE.md top
- [ ] Test: Does re-reading stop?

**Phase 3: Full Optimization**
- [ ] Reduce CLAUDE.md (500 → 200 tokens)
- [ ] Optimize session-start (100 → 10 tokens)
