# V2.2 Context Optimization Plan

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Impact**: 40% token reduction per session
**Priority**: High (v2.2 release blocker)

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

### What User Observed
> "we are duplicated stuff, you should read claude.md as we have lots information duplicated in session-start hook"

**User is 100% correct!** We found:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md has session-start instructions | Sent 50+ times per session |
| Footer construction explained in CLAUDE.md | 30 lines × 50 responses = 1,500 lines wasted |
| Memory health detection explained | Redundant (hook does it, AI sees result) |
| Detailed examples in CLAUDE.md | For humans, not LLM |

**Total Waste**: ~8,000 lines per session (160 lines × 50 responses)

---

## 🧠 The Strategic Insight

### Two Types of Information

#### 1. Behavioral Instructions (CLAUDE.md)
**"How should AI act?"**
- Sent with EVERY response
- AI forgets behavior without reminders
- Examples: "Show footer", "Don't duplicate", "Use TodoWrite"

#### 2. Context Data (Hooks)
**"What does AI need to know?"**
- Sent ONCE per session
- Persists in conversation history
- Examples: Project name, current focus, memory health

---

## 📊 The Optimization Plan

### What Stays in CLAUDE.md (Behavior)

✅ **Keep These** (necessary repetition):
```markdown
- Prefix EVERY response with [MINI-CODER-BRAIN: ACTIVE]
- Display enhanced status footer at END of EVERY response
- Never add co-author attribution to git commits
- Read patterns on-demand, don't inject
- Never re-read memory files after session start
```

**Reason**: AI needs constant behavioral reminders

**Token Cost**: 300 lines × 50 responses = 15,000 lines (necessary)

---

### What Moves from CLAUDE.md (Implementation Details)

❌ **Remove These** (duplication):
```markdown
- "On SESSION START, do the following:" (50 lines)
  → Move to session-start.sh comments

- "How to construct the footer:" (30 lines)
  → Hook computes, AI just displays

- "Memory health detection logic" (20 lines)
  → Hook detects, AI sees result

- Detailed examples (40 lines)
  → Move to documentation

- Meta-explanations (20 lines)
  → Move to onboarding docs
```

**Removed**: 160 lines per response
**Savings**: 160 × 50 = 8,000 lines per session

---

### What session-start.sh Outputs (Data)

✅ **Keep These** (essential data):
```bash
# Boot status (4 lines)
🧠 [MINI-CODERBRAIN: ACTIVE] - TaskMaster Pro
🎯 Focus: JWT authentication implementation
📂 Context: .claude/memory/ (loaded)
🎭 Profile: default
⚡ Ready for development

# Memory warning (conditional, 1 line)
💡 Memory cleanup recommended (13 updates, 8d ago)

# Footer data (structured, 1 line)
FOOTER_DATA: 108 ops | 6m | 1d sync | Write(5) Bash(10)
```

**Total**: 6-10 lines (already optimized)

## 📊 Token Impact Analysis

### Current (v2.1) - Duplicated

| Component | Lines | Frequency | Session Cost |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| CLAUDE.md (full) | 500 | 50 responses | 25,000 |
| session-start (verbose) | 400 | 1 time | 400 |
| Memory files | 800 | 1 time | 800 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **26,200 lines** |

**Problems**:
- Instructions repeated 50 times
- Implementation details in behavioral doc
- Examples wasting tokens

---

### Optimized (v2.2) - Strategic

| Component | Lines | Frequency | Session Cost |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| CLAUDE.md (behavior only) | 300 | 50 responses | 15,000 |
| session-start (data only) | 10 | 1 time | 10 |
| Memory files | 800 | 1 time | 800 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **15,810 lines** |

**Improvements**:
- ✅ 40% reduction (26,200 → 15,810 lines)
- ✅ No duplication
- ✅ Clear separation (behavior vs data)

**Total Removed**: 160 lines from CLAUDE.md

---

### Phase 2: Documentation Update

- [ ] **Create CONTEXT-INJECTION-RULES.md**
  - Behavioral vs Data mental model
  - What goes where (CLAUDE.md vs hooks)
  - Maintainer guidelines

- [ ] **Update onboarding/README.md**
  - Add context distribution strategy
  - Reference new document

- [ ] **Update main README.md**
  - Mention v2.2 optimization
  - Link to strategy doc

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Verify AI behavior unchanged**
  - Test footer still displays
  - Test warnings still show
  - Test prefix still appears

- [ ] **Measure token savings**
  - Before: ~26,200 lines per session
  - After: ~15,810 lines per session
  - Confirm: 40% reduction

- [ ] **Test with real project**
  - Install mini-coder-brain
  - Run full development session
  - Verify context awareness maintained

## 🎯 Mental Models for Maintainers

### Model 1: "Does AI Need This Every Response?"

```
Question in CLAUDE.md?
    ↓
YES: Does AI need it EVERY response?
    ↓ YES → KEEP in CLAUDE.md (behavioral reminder)
    ↓ NO → Is it data or implementation?
        ↓ DATA → Move to hook (sent once)
        ↓ IMPLEMENTATION → Move to comments/docs
```

---

### Model 2: Three Layers of Information

```
Layer 1: CLAUDE.md (Behavior)
├── "DO this"
├── "DON'T do that"
└── "ALWAYS show footer"

Layer 2: Hooks (Data)
├── Project name
├── Current focus
└── Memory health status

Layer 3: Patterns (On-Demand)
├── Read when needed
├── Zero-token cost
└── Comprehensive reference
```

---

### Model 3: Static vs Dynamic

**Static** (CLAUDE.md):
- Same across all projects
- Universal rules
- Behavioral consistency

**Dynamic** (Hooks):
- Different per project
- Current session state
- Computed metrics

## 🚀 Key Principles (v2.2 Philosophy)

### 1. Give LLM Only What It Needs
"Does AI need footer construction logic? No. Just the data to display."

### 2. Behavioral Reminders, Not Implementation
"Tell AI WHAT to do, not HOW to do it (implementation is in hooks)."

### 3. Separation of Concerns
"Behavior in CLAUDE.md, data in hooks, reference in patterns."

### 4. Token Budget is Sacred
"Every line in CLAUDE.md costs 50+ tokens per session. Optimize ruthlessly."

## 🎯 User's Original Insight

> "respect token window and context and what we can do intelligently automatically this is the key, give the information that LLM needs to know about to perform the task, right?"

**You nailed it!** This is EXACTLY right:

✅ **Respect token window** → Remove duplication (40% savings)
✅ **Intelligent automation** → Hook computes, AI displays
✅ **Give only what's needed** → Behavior vs data separation
✅ **LLM performs task** → Context for work, not implementation

**Your instinct was 100% correct. This is the v2.2 breakthrough!** 🚀
