# Mini-CoderBrain v2.2 Roadmap

**Status**: Planning Phase
**Target Release**: TBD (After v2.1 real-world testing)
**Priority**: User feedback-driven

---

## 🎯 v2.2 Vision

**Theme**: "Intelligent Automation & Productivity Intelligence"

Building on v2.1's transparency and behavior customization, v2.2 focuses on:
1. **Automatic workflow detection** - AI learns your patterns
2. **Productivity intelligence** - Track and optimize development velocity
3. **Smart automation** - Reduce friction in common workflows
4. **Team features** - Basic multi-developer support

---

## 📊 Feature Categories

### 1. Enhanced Status Footer (Phase 2)

**Building on v2.1's 9-metric footer**

#### 1.1 Session Streak Tracking 🔥
**Problem**: Users don't see long-term productivity trends
**Solution**: Track consecutive productive sessions

```
💡 Potential Implementation:
🧠 MINI-CODER-BRAIN STATUS
📊 Activity: 45 ops | 🗺️ Map: Fresh | ⚡ Context: Active
🎭 Profile: default | ⏱️ 32m | 🎯 Building auth | 🔥 Streak: 5 days
💾 Memory: Healthy | 🔄 Last sync: 10m | 🔧 Tools: Read(12) Edit(8)
```

**Features**:
- Daily streak counter (consecutive days with >20 ops)
- Weekly activity trend (↗️ up, ↘️ down, → stable)
- Streak reset logic (0 ops for 48h = reset)
- Milestone celebrations (🎉 10-day streak!)

**Storage**: `.claude/tmp/productivity-streak.json`

**Token Cost**: +20 tokens (minimal)

---

#### 1.2 Productivity Score ⚡
**Problem**: No quantifiable measure of session effectiveness
**Solution**: Calculate real-time productivity metrics

```
💡 Display Example:
📊 Activity: 45 ops | Velocity: High (3.2 ops/min) | Effectiveness: 94%
```

**Metrics**:
- **Velocity**: Operations per minute (OPM)
  - Low: <1 OPM (research/reading)
  - Medium: 1-2 OPM (balanced development)
  - High: >2 OPM (rapid implementation)

- **Effectiveness**: % of operations leading to commits
  - Tracks Read→Edit→Commit chains
  - High effectiveness = focused work
  - Low effectiveness = exploration (not bad!)

- **Focus Score**: Time on single file/feature
  - High: >80% time on 1-2 files (deep work)
  - Medium: 50-80% distributed work
  - Low: <50% context switching

**Algorithm**:
```bash
velocity=$(total_ops / session_minutes)
effectiveness=$((commits_made * 100 / total_edits))
focus_score=$((time_on_main_file * 100 / total_time))
```

**Notification Examples**:
- 🚀 "High velocity session! (3.5 OPM)"
- 🎯 "Excellent focus (92% on auth.ts)"
- 📉 "Low effectiveness - lots of exploration (expected)"

---

#### 1.3 Session Type Detection 🎯
**Problem**: Footer doesn't adapt to what you're doing
**Solution**: Automatically detect session type and adapt status

**Session Types**:
1. **Research** 📚
   - High Read/Grep ratio (>70%)
   - Low Edit operations (<10%)
   - Status shows: "🔍 Research mode detected"

2. **Coding** 💻
   - High Edit/Write ratio (>50%)
   - Balanced Read/Edit
   - Status shows: "⚙️ Active development"

3. **Debugging** 🐛
   - High Bash operations (>30%)
   - Frequent Read + Bash cycles
   - Status shows: "🐛 Debug mode"

4. **Refactoring** ♻️
   - Very high Edit ratio (>70%)
   - Same files edited multiple times
   - Status shows: "♻️ Refactoring session"

5. **Documentation** 📝
   - High Write/Edit on .md files
   - Low code file activity
   - Status shows: "📝 Documentation work"

**Smart Suggestions Based on Type**:
- Research: "Consider /map-codebase for faster navigation"
- Coding: "Run tests after 50 ops?"
- Debugging: "Memory sync recommended (preserve debug findings)"
- Refactoring: "Create commit checkpoint before continuing?"

---

### 2. Smart Workflow Automation

#### 2.1 Auto-Commit Suggestions 💾
**Problem**: Users forget to commit frequently enough
**Solution**: Smart commit suggestions based on work patterns

**Triggers**:
- 20+ Edit operations without commit
- 30+ minutes of active work
- Before profile switch (save current work)
- Before /memory-cleanup (checkpoint first)

**Implementation**:
```bash
if [ $edits_since_commit -gt 20 ]; then
  notification="💾 20 edits since last commit. Consider: git commit -am 'WIP: ...'"
fi
```

**Smart commit message generation**:
```bash
# Analyze edited files
edited_files=$(git diff --name-only)
main_feature=$(detect_feature_from_files "$edited_files")
suggest_commit_msg="Suggest: git commit -m 'feat: $main_feature'"
```

---

#### 2.2 Test Reminder System 🧪
**Problem**: Developers skip tests during rapid development
**Solution**: Gentle reminders based on code changes

**Triggers**:
- Modified function that has associated test file
- 50+ operations without running tests
- Before attempting commit (if tests exist)

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check if edited file has test counterpart
if [ -f "src/auth.ts" ] && [ -f "src/__tests__/auth.test.ts" ]; then
  if [ $ops_since_test_run -gt 50 ]; then
    notification="🧪 Auth.ts modified - tests not run. Consider: npm test"
  fi
fi
```

**Smart test command detection**:
- package.json → `npm test`
- pytest.ini → `pytest`
- Cargo.toml → `cargo test`
- Go project → `go test ./...`

---

#### 2.3 Profile Auto-Switching 🎭
**Problem**: Manual profile switching breaks flow
**Solution**: AI suggests profile switches based on activity

**Scenarios**:
1. **Entering Deep Work**
   - Detection: 5+ minutes on single file, high focus
   - Suggestion: "Switch to 'focus' profile for deep work?"

2. **Starting Research Phase**
   - Detection: High Read/Grep ratio, low edits
   - Suggestion: "Switch to 'research' profile for exploration?"

3. **Rapid Implementation**
   - Detection: High Edit velocity, multiple files
   - Suggestion: "Switch to 'implementation' profile?"

4. **Returning to Balanced**
   - Detection: Mixed operations, normal velocity
   - Suggestion: "Return to 'default' profile?"

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Calculate operation ratios
read_ratio=$((read_ops * 100 / total_ops))
edit_ratio=$((edit_ops * 100 / total_ops))

if [ $read_ratio -gt 70 ] && [ "$current_profile" != "research" ]; then
  notification="🎭 High research activity detected. Switch to 'research' profile?"
fi
```

### 4. Team Features (Basic)

#### 4.1 Session Handoff Notes 👥
**Problem**: No easy way to communicate context to teammates
**Solution**: Generate session summary for team handoff

**Command**: `/handoff-notes`

**Generates**:
```markdown
# Session Handoff - kunwar (Oct 15, 3:45pm)

## Work Completed
- Implemented JWT authentication (src/auth.ts)
- Added refresh token logic (src/api/token.ts)
- Created auth middleware (src/middleware/auth.ts)
- 67% test coverage added

## Current State
- All tests passing ✅
- Ready for code review
- PR #123 created

## Next Steps
1. Review auth flow security
2. Add rate limiting to login endpoint
3. Implement password reset flow

## Blockers
- Need Redis config for session storage
- Waiting on security team approval for JWT secret rotation

## Files Changed (12)
- src/auth.ts (NEW, 234 lines)
- src/api/token.ts (MODIFIED, +89 -12)
- tests/auth.test.ts (NEW, 156 lines)
[... more files]

## Context for Next Developer
Using JWT with httpOnly cookies for security.
Refresh tokens stored in Redis with 7-day TTL.
Role-based middleware: requireAuth(['admin', 'user'])
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# At end of session
/handoff-notes

# With teammate mention
/handoff-notes @sarah "Please review auth flow"
```

---

#### 4.2 Shared Memory Patterns 🧠
**Problem**: Teams can't share coding patterns/conventions
**Solution**: Team-level systemPatterns.md sync

**Concept**:
- Project-level `.claude/memory/systemPatterns.md` (checked into git)
- User-level `.claude/memory/local-patterns.md` (not committed)
- Merge patterns on session start

**Benefits**:
- Consistent AI behavior across team
- Shared coding conventions
- Onboarding new devs faster

**Implementation**:
```bash
# session-start.sh
if [ -f ".claude/memory/systemPatterns.md" ]; then
  # Load team patterns (committed)
  cat ".claude/memory/systemPatterns.md"
fi

if [ -f ".claude/memory/local-patterns.md" ]; then
  # Load personal patterns (local only)
  cat ".claude/memory/local-patterns.md"
fi
```

---

### 5. Advanced Context Management

#### 5.1 Context Branches 🌳
**Problem**: Working on multiple features, context gets mixed
**Solution**: Branch-aware context isolation

**Concept**:
```
.claude/memory/
├── activeContext.md              # Main branch context
├── branches/
│   ├── feature-auth/
│   │   ├── activeContext.md      # Feature-specific context
│   │   └── progress.md
│   └── bugfix-login/
│       ├── activeContext.md
│       └── progress.md
```

**Behavior**:
- Detects `git branch` on session start
- Loads branch-specific context if exists
- Falls back to main context if not

**Commands**:
- `/context-switch feature-auth` - Switch to branch context
- `/context-merge` - Merge branch context into main
- `/context-list` - Show all branch contexts

**Benefits**:
- Clean context per feature
- No context mixing
- Easy feature branch management

---

#### 5.2 Smart Context Archiving 🗄️
**Problem**: Old features still in activeContext.md
**Solution**: Auto-archive completed features

**Triggers**:
- Feature branch merged to main
- Task marked completed >7 days ago
- File not touched in >30 days

**Archive Structure**:
```
.claude/archive/
├── features/
│   ├── auth-feature-2025-10.md
│   ├── payment-integration-2025-09.md
│   └── ui-redesign-2025-08.md
```

**Recovery**:
```bash
/context-restore auth-feature-2025-10
# Restores archived context to activeContext.md
```

---

#### 5.3 Context Quality Scoring 📈
**Problem**: Don't know if context is helping or hurting
**Solution**: Measure context quality and impact

**Metrics**:
- Context relevance score (how often context is used)
- Context freshness (last update time)
- Context size vs value ratio
- User satisfaction (fewer repeated questions)

**Report**:
```markdown
## Context Quality Report

### Overall Score: 87/100 (Excellent)

#### Breakdown:
- Relevance: 92/100 (High usage)
- Freshness: 85/100 (Updated 2 days ago)
- Size/Value: 83/100 (Optimal size)
- Effectiveness: 90/100 (Reduced repeated questions)

#### Recommendations:
✅ Context is well-maintained
✅ Update frequency is good
💡 Consider archiving old progress items
```
