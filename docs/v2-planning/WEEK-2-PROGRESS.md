# Week 2 Progress - Behavior Profiles System

**Branch**: v2.1-development
**Status**: ✅ Day 1 Complete
**Token Impact**: +200 tokens per session (profile-specific)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (Day 1)

### 1. Behavior Profiles System Design
Created comprehensive behavior profile system for customizable AI modes:

**Core Concept**:
- Profiles define HOW the AI should behave in different contexts
- Settings: output_style, proactivity, explanation_depth, communication
- Context priorities: Which memory files to check first
- Tool preferences: Which tools to prefer/avoid
- Behavioral adjustments: Custom rules per profile

**Design Goals**:
- Minimal token impact (~200 tokens per session)
- Load once at session start (persist throughout)
- Easy to customize (markdown files)
- Backward compatible (default profile = current behavior)

---

### 2. Four Core Profiles Created

#### Profile 1: default.md
**Token Cost**: ~200 tokens
**Best For**: General development, full-stack work, learning projects

**Key Settings**:
- output_style: balanced
- proactivity: medium (suggest at milestones)
- explanation_depth: standard
- communication: friendly

**Personality**: Knowledgeable teammate who remembers context, suggests helpful next steps

---

#### Profile 2: focus.md
**Token Cost**: ~150 tokens (25% lighter)
**Best For**: Complex implementation, bug fixes, time-sensitive work

**Key Settings**:
- output_style: terse (minimal output)
- proactivity: low (only critical suggestions)
- explanation_depth: minimal
- communication: efficient

**Personality**: Developer in deep focus with headphones on - execute rapidly, no distractions

**Token Savings**:
- Shorter responses (~50 words vs ~150)
- Fewer suggestions (0-1 vs 2-5 per session)
- Skip unnecessary context checks

---

#### Profile 3: research.md
**Token Cost**: ~300 tokens (50% heavier)
**Best For**: Understanding codebase, learning patterns, documentation

**Key Settings**:
- output_style: verbose (detailed explanations)
- proactivity: high (proactive insights)
- explanation_depth: detailed (explain WHY)
- communication: educational

**Personality**: Senior architect doing knowledge transfer - thoroughly explore, explain deeply

**Research Methodology**:
1. Discover (find all relevant files/patterns)
2. Read (understand each component)
3. Analyze (identify relationships)
4. Synthesize (build comprehensive understanding)
5. Document (create clear explanations)
6. Validate (verify understanding)

---

#### Profile 4: implementation.md
**Token Cost**: ~200 tokens
**Best For**: Feature development, prototyping, rapid iteration

**Key Settings**:
- output_style: balanced (action-focused)
- proactivity: medium (suggest next steps actively)
- explanation_depth: minimal (explain briefly)
- communication: directive

**Personality**: Fast-moving startup developer - build features quickly, test continuously, ship code

**Feature Building Flow**:
1. Plan (30 seconds)
2. Scaffold (quick structure)
3. Implement (iterative build)
4. Test (continuous validation)
5. Polish (error handling, edge cases)
6. Commit (checkpoint)

### 3. Custom Profile Template
Created comprehensive template for users to create their own profiles:

**Template Includes**:
- Core settings explanation
- Focus areas definition
- Context priority customization
- Tool preference specification
- Behavioral adjustment guidelines
- Example session flows
- Complete documentation

**Usage**:
1. Copy custom-template.md to new file
2. Fill in all bracketed sections
3. Test in development session
4. Refine based on experience
5. Share with community (optional)

### 4. Profile System Integration

#### CLAUDE.md Updates
**Added**:
- `behavior_profile` setting in Project Setup Metadata (line ~41)
- Profile loading instructions in Session Bootstrapping Rules
- Profile information in Core Features list

**Format**:
```yaml
# Behavior Profile (v2.1+)
behavior_profile: "default"  # default / focus / research / implementation / custom-name
```

---

#### Session-Start Hook Updates
**Added profile detection logic**:
1. Extract `behavior_profile` setting from CLAUDE.md
2. Check if profile file exists in `.claude/profiles/`
3. Fall back to "default" if not found or invalid
4. Display active profile in session status

**Output Change**:
```
🧠 [MINI-CODERBRAIN: ACTIVE] - mini-coder-brain
🎯 Focus: V2.1 development
📂 Context: .claude/memory/ (loaded)
🎭 Profile: default             ← NEW LINE
⚡ Ready for development
```

---

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

#### .claude/profiles/README.md
**Content**:
- What behavior profiles are
- Available profiles overview
- How profiles work (selection, loading, behaviors)
- Profile format specification
- Usage guide
- Token impact analysis
- Profile selection guide
- Custom profile creation
- Best practices

**Size**: ~400 lines

## 📊 Token Impact Analysis

### Profile Loading
**At session start**:
- Profile file read: ~150-300 tokens (varies by profile)
- No re-loading during session
- Persists in conversation history naturally

### Profile Comparison
| Profile | Token Cost | Output Length | Suggestions | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| focus | ~150 tokens | ~50 words | 0-1/session | Deep work, time-sensitive |
| default | ~200 tokens | ~150 words | 2-5/session | General development |
| implementation | ~200 tokens | ~150 words | 3-6/session | Rapid feature building |
| research | ~300 tokens | ~300 words | 5-10/session | Learning, exploration |

### Net Impact
**Total V2.1 Token Cost**:
- Week 1 (Patterns): +0 tokens (read on-demand)
- Week 2 (Profiles): +200 tokens average per session
- **Combined**: +200 tokens (~0.1% of context window)

**Compared to v1.0**: Still maintaining 79%+ token efficiency

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 1. Customizable Behavior
- Choose AI mode based on task context
- Optimize output style for workflow
- Adjust proactivity to preference

### 2. Token Flexibility
- Use lighter profiles (focus) for longer conversations
- Use heavier profiles (research) when deep understanding needed
- Balanced default for everyday work

### 3. User Empowerment
- Full control via simple markdown files
- Easy to create custom profiles
- No coding required for customization

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Default profile = v1.0 behavior
- Existing projects work unchanged
- Optional feature activation

## 🔄 Profile Switching

### Persistent (Project-Level)
In `CLAUDE.md`:
```yaml
behavior_profile: "focus"  # Applies to all sessions
```

### Temporary (Session-Level)
Via environment variable:
```bash
echo "MCB_PROFILE=research" > .claude/.env
# Applies to this session only
```

**Note**: Environment variable support planned for Week 3

✅ Template for custom profiles ready
⏳ Real-world testing pending
⏳ User feedback pending
⏳ Profile refinement based on usage pending

### Next Steps (Week 2 Day 2+)
1. Test each profile in real development sessions
2. Measure actual token usage per profile
3. Gather feedback on profile effectiveness
4. Refine profile behaviors based on experience

## 🎓 Design Insights

### Why Profiles Work
1. **Context-appropriate behavior**: Different tasks need different approaches
2. **Token optimization**: Lighter profiles for longer conversations
3. **User preference**: Some users want terse, others want verbose
4. **Learning curve**: Default profile onboards, advanced users customize

### Profile vs. Patterns
**Patterns** (Week 1):
- WHAT to do (pre-response checklist, tool selection)
- Reference material (read on-demand)
- Universal rules (apply to all profiles)

**Profiles** (Week 2):
- HOW to do it (communication style, output length)
- Active configuration (loaded at session start)
- Context-specific behavior (different per task)

**Relationship**:
- Profiles reference patterns for guidance
- Patterns provide universal rules
- Profiles customize the application of rules
