- Optional pattern library usage

### Context Efficiency (Critical)
- **NO DUPLICATION** of context injection
- Load-once principle maintained
- Pattern library read on-demand
- Profile loaded at session start only
- Flag-based reload prevention

### Performance

## 💡 Key Principles for v2.0

### 1. Behavior Training > Tools
Focus on HOW to use capabilities, not adding more capabilities.

### 2. Document > Implement
Understand what works before building new systems.

### 3. Modular > Monolithic
Break patterns into reusable components.

### 4. Explicit > Implicit
Make behavior training rules clear and documented.

### 5. Efficient > Comprehensive
Maintain token efficiency while adding features.

### 6. Universal > Domain-Specific
Design methodology that works beyond coding.

## 💬 Open Questions

### Technical
1. How to implement profile selection without token bloat?
2. Best format for pattern library (MD vs. structured data)?
3. How to measure behavioral effectiveness automatically?
4. Can we A/B test different behavioral patterns?

### Strategic
1. Should v2.0 remain coding-focused or generalize immediately?
2. How to balance modularity with simplicity?
3. Should patterns be community-contributed?
4. Is adaptive learning (v3.0) realistic or over-ambitious?

### Tactical
1. When to release v2.0 (stable or iterate publicly)?
2. How to migrate v1.0 users to v2.0?
3. Should profiles be optional or default?
4. How much documentation is too much?

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

This roadmap is based on the foundational insight:

> "I had all the tools but failed because I never thought about behavior training"

The success of Mini-CoderBrain v1.0 proves that **behavior training is more valuable than technical tools**. V2.0 will make this insight explicit, documented, and reusable.

---

**Status**: Phase 1.1 Complete (Foundation Documentation)
**Next**: Phase 1.2 (Pattern Extraction)
**Target**: v2.0 release in 6-8 weeks
